            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>ADAM</hi> in Innocency and Integrity was in a ſtate of perfect friendship with God, of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull conformity to His Image, and of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comfortable Communion with him; But alace! he continued very short time in that excellent ſtate; for the entering in of ſin, by his Tranſgresſing the Law and condition of the Covenant of works, quite brake off the friendſhip, utterly disfigured and defaced the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and altogether interrupted and put a ſtop to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: He having thereby run himſelf and his Poſterity under a forfeiture of that deſireable ſtate, and of all the Precious Priviledges annexed to it, under which himſelf and they had lyen Eternally, had not God in the depth of
<pb facs="tcp:179825:5"/> his infinit wiſdom, and in the exceeding and unſearchable Riches of his free Grace and Mercy, deviſed and found out a way for taking off that forfeiture, <hi>By ſending his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them that were under the Law;</hi> who according to the Covenant of Redemption treated and Tranſacted, finally concluded and agreed betwixt <hi>Jehovah</hi> and him; having made a moſt coſtly, but a moſt Compleat Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Provoked Divine Juſtice for the debt of the Elect, In whoſe room, for that end he did ſurrogat and ſubſtitute himſelf, as their Surety and Cautioner, hath reeſtablished the friendſhip, reſtored the Conformity, and recovered the Communion: of which Glad tidings of great joy Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication is made in the Preached Goſpel: the Tabernacle of the Ordinances whereof is reared up amongſt men, that thereby <hi>God the Lord may dwell among them:</hi> Theſe Ordinances in their inſtitution and nature being means of Communion and fellowship betwixt God and men: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which Divinely inſtituted Ordinances, that of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> beareth expresſly the name of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> becauſe, often and ordinarily the greateſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and higheſt degrees of Communion with God in Chriſt attainable by ſojourning and militant Saints here on Earth, are win at in the Participation of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the great pledge and love-token of our dieing Lords deareſt reſpect to his Diſciples and followers, calling and oblidging them, in the uſe thereof, to a Solemn Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him and of his love, and to a Publick and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched Declaration of his Death till he come again: Therefore is it beyond all other Goſpell. Ordinances, as it were, railed about with ſuch injunctions, Cautions, and warnings; with ſuch terrible threatnings, with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of Atrocious Guilt, and with ſuch denouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of formidable Judgements againſt unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants,
<pb facs="tcp:179825:5"/> Thunder and Lightnings (as it were) being ſpoken againſt ſuch. The deſirable deceaſed Author of theſe few following Sermons Preached at Communions, uſed at ſuch occaſions to endeavour, through Grace, to rouſe and work up himſelf to ſuch a Divineneſs of frame, as very much ſuited the Spiritual ſtate and Majeſty of that Ordinance, greatly fearing leſt himſelf, or any of the People to whom he diſpenſed the ſame, should fall under the grievous <hi>Guilt of the Body and Blood of the Lord;</hi> then, in a manner, his face shone, as being in the mount of Communion and fellowship with God, and at ſome of thoſe Solemn and ſweet Occaſions, he ſpake ſome way as a man that had been in Heaven, Commending Jeſus Chriſt; making a Glorious diſplay of the Banner of free Grace, holding forth the Riches of it very clearly and convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and bringing the offers thereof very low, wonderfully low; So that in hearing ſome of theſe Sermons. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that on <hi>Matth. 22.</hi> I was made to think, that the Rope or Cord of the Offer of Salvation was let down and hung ſo low to ſinners, that thoſe of the loweſt ſtature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them all, though but as <hi>Pygmees,</hi> might have catcht hold of it, who, through Grace, had any mind to do ſo: and ſo home, ſo vehemently and urgently preſſed, on ſo ſweet and eaſie terms to be embraced, that I have been ſometimes made to wonder how the hearers could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or shift them: But there is no ſaving Belief of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port made by Prophets, Apoſtles, Yea or by Bleſſed Jeſus himſelf in his own Perſonall Miniſtrie, but where <hi>the arm of the Lord is Revealed, No man can</hi> or will (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, beſeech and Perſwade who will, if it were not only men, but even Angels,) <hi>come to the Son except the Father that ſent him draw him;</hi> There is no moving here without a pull of Ommipotencie; none are nor can be willing to yeeld themſelves to Chriſt, till <hi>the day of his
<pb facs="tcp:179825:6"/> Power</hi> Paſs on their hearts; till then, they will ſit the moſt presſing calls of the Goſpel, but then they can ſit no longer, they muſt, they will riſe then, and run after him, they will then (as the word ſignifies) make <hi>a free will Offering</hi> of themſelves to thim, however inexortable and inflexible they had shewed themſelves before, they will then make an abſolute, entire, univerſall, unexceptioned and Irreverſible Surrender and Reſignation of themſelves to him, to be at his diſpoſe, to be guided and ſaved by him in his own way. I know, the Remembrance of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Sabbaths, <hi>High Sabbaths,</hi> and other ordinary Sabbaths and week days, wherein you Siſter, and other Serious ſeekers of God in <hi>Glaſgow</hi> in particular, <hi>heard the joyfull ſound, walked in the light of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and Rejoiced in his Name all the day,</hi> Living in a Holy croud of Precious Goſpel-Ordinances, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, the Heavenly Manna of the Goſpel fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abundantly about your Camp every day, making you think and ſay, that <hi>it was good to be there,</hi> is this day ſweet and Savoury to you, and helps you in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to keep up a ſuitable and due eſteem of fellowship and Communion with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, which is commended and indeared to your Souls and to the Souls of others of the Lords People, by the choice, rare, excellent and non-ſuch Nature and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, It being found by you all, Priviledged with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſion to the enjoyment thereof, in your experience to be: <hi>Firſt,</hi> moſt <hi>Real</hi> and no Chimerical fancy, or a thing that hath no being but in the deluded imagination of the Perſon; <hi>and truly</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John. 1 Jon. 1.3.

<pb facs="tcp:179825:6"/> Remarkable Objects: And no doubt, the more Spiritual any thing is, It hath in it the greater reality, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the more Powerfully and efficaciouſly; It is uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible and quite removed from all reach of rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, that <hi>God</hi> is the greateſt reality, and by Proportion Communion with God, Whereby neareſt and cloſeſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches are made to him, must be very real: marvellous are the effects of this Communion, <hi>and that your Souls know right well,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>Pſal. 139 14.</hi> in another caſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is an <hi>Awfull</hi> Fellowship and full of dread, It impreſſeth the Soul with a deep, yet kindly veneration of the Glorious Majeſty of the great and Holy God, <hi>Who</hi> (as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal. 89.</hi> verſ. <hi>7.) Is greatly to be feared in the aſſemblies of his Saints</hi> (where they are admitted to fellowship with him) <hi>and to be had in reverence by all that are about him;</hi> When <hi>Jacob</hi> was admitted to very near Communion with him, <hi>Gen. 28.</hi> He ſaith, verſ. <hi>16.

I have heard of Thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Thee, wherefore I abhore my ſelf and repent in duſt and ashes:</hi> The neareſt approaches to that light wherein there is no darkneſs at all, make the cleareſt diſcoveries of the moſt eminent Saints their unworthineſs, nothingneſs, and vileneſs. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is <hi>a Transforming</hi> Fellowship, and asſimilats the Perſon Priviledged with admisſion to it, to Him that is converſed with, and with whom Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship is attained unto: there is no real Communion with him, but the reſult of it is ſome lineament of further likeneſs to him; <hi>We all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>2 Cor. 3.18.) Beholding the Glory of the Lord as in a Glaſs, are changed</hi> (or transformed) <hi>into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> Communion with and conformity to God have mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Reciprocall force each upon other: the more Communion with him, the more likeneſs and conformity to him, the more likeneſs to him, the more Communion with him: litle Communion with him makes litle conformity to him, and litle conformity to him cannot but be attended with litle Communion with him. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is a <hi>wonderful</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:179825:7"/> Fellowship, a fellowship that even ſometimes tranſports, in a manner, the Soul admitted to it, eſpecially in any more then Ordinary way or meaſure, into a ſort of Rapture and extaſy of Admiration at it: Thus it did <hi>David, 2 Sa. 7.18. Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>am I, O Lord, and what is my Fathers houſe, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> who being very near to God, in that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn prayer of his at the Dedication of the Temple, ſaith, <hi>1 Kings 8.27. But will God indeed dwell with men on earth?</hi> and as it is, <hi>2 Chron. 6. verſ. 18. But will God in very deed dwell with men on Earth?</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is no great wonder that it be greatly wondered at, that the Infinitly great and Holy God <hi>who inhabiteth Eternity,</hi> and <hi>the High and Lofty one who dweleth in the High and Holy Place,</hi> and is ſurrounded and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, with an Innumerable Company of Angels, &amp; of the Spirits &amp; of Juſt men made Perfect, all of them shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in light and burning in zeal, none of them wearying to do him ſervice, should humble himſelf ſo far and ſtoop ſo low, ſo very low, as to dwell <hi>alſo</hi> (an Emphatick <hi>alſo</hi>) with ſinful, though <hi>humble and contrit</hi> Creatures, <hi>who dwell in Cottages of clay</hi> and <hi>whoſe habitation is in the duſt,</hi> that he <hi>who is of purer eyes then that he can behold iniquity</hi> without deteſtation and abhorrency, should yet humble himſelf not only to <hi>Behold,</hi> but with delight to <hi>dwell</hi> and keep fellowship with them, who are in a great meaſure unholy, and have ſo much of that dwelling in them, which his Soul hates; that the Glorious Perſons of the dreadful and adorable God head should come and make their abode with ſuch, in whom ſo great a Remainder of ſtinking unmortified Corruption hath ſtill its abode; that infinitly pure and perfect light should have fellowship with them in whom there is ſo much darkneſs. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is an <hi>eſtranging</hi> fellowship from all Idols, and what
<pb facs="tcp:179825:8"/> ever is diſpleaſing to God and eſtranging from him; Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Ephraim</hi> being brought near to him, ſaith <hi>(Hoſ. 14. v. 8.) what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> and the people of God ſuppoſed to be in a good Spiritual frame and near to him, ſay, <hi>Iſai. 30 22.</hi> to every Idol (which they caſt away as <hi>a menſtruous Cloth</hi>) with Indignation and abhorrency, <hi>get thee hence:</hi> and <hi>David</hi> being admitted to very near Communion with God, <hi>Pſal. 6.</hi> ſaith <hi>v. 8.</hi> To wicked men by whoſe company he might have been eſtranged from him, <hi>depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping, the Lord hath heard the voice of my Supplication:</hi> And indeed it is Highly ſuitable and congruous, that it should be ſo, <hi>for what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> and Believers <hi>are the Temple of the living God,</hi> as the Apoſtle affirms <hi>2 Cor. 6.16. Seventhly,</hi> It is a heart quickening and <hi>reviving</hi> Fellowship; Therefore he is ſaid, <hi>Iſai. 57.</hi> verſ. <hi>15. To dwel with him that is humble and of a contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite one. Eightly,</hi> It is <hi>a heart-ſtaying, Calming</hi> and <hi>compoſing</hi> fellowship, it husheth into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and drives away diſquieting, Perplexing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating fears; And therefore ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> when near to God, <hi>Pſal. 3.56. I laid me down and ſlept, I awaked, for the Lord ſuſtained me, I will not be afraid of ten thouſands of People that have ſet themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me round about</hi>

               </gap> and <hi>Pſal. 4 8. I will both lay me down in Peace, and ſleep, for thou Lord only mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me dwell in ſafety:</hi> So <hi>Pſal. 27.13, 14. Ninthly,</hi> It is a heart <hi>chearing, refreshing,</hi> and <hi>Rejoicing</hi> fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the refreshing and joy that reſult from fellowship with God, do quite ſurpaſs and tranſcend the joy that the men of the world have in the enjoyment of all their earthly
<pb facs="tcp:179825:8"/> Pleaſures; <hi>Lift thou up</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> in the name of the Godly, <hi>Pſal. 4.7.</hi> In contradiſtinction from and oppoſition to thoſe <hi>many</hi> who cry, <hi>who will ſhew us any good?</hi> debaſing, and in a manner, brutifieing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if they had not rational and Immortal Souls ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of enjoying God the chief good, the only Object ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Compleatly to ſatisfie their moſt inlarged deſires) <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us, for thou haſt cauſed more joy of heart to me,</hi> (to wit, thereby) <hi>Then when their Corn and Wine abound:</hi> And <hi>Pſal. 89.16.</hi> thoſe who <hi>walk in the light of His Countenance</hi> are ſaid to <hi>Rejoice in his name all the day:</hi> Thus, when he Prays, <hi>Pſal. 43.</hi> For admisſion to fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God in his publick ordinances (to which he had gone with others of his people, <hi>with the voice of joy and gladneſs, as they that kept Holy days,</hi> as he telleth us in the Preceeding Pſalm) he promiſeth in that caſe, that he will <hi>go unto the altar of God, unto God his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy,</hi> the gladneſs or joy of his joy, the very heart and Soul of his joy, or the Cream of it, as ſome tranſlations render the word; there is reality, Solidity, ſtrength and Efficacy, in that joy; it is <hi>heart-joy,</hi> while as in the very midſt of the carnal joy, jollity and mirth of natural men ariſing from the greateſt affluence of worldly pleaſures and enjoyments, <hi>their heart is ſorrowfull,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith: there is no ſolidity in it, it hath not a bottom: if they would but a little retire within themſelves and ask for a reaſon of their laughter, mirth, and jollity, it would inſtantly evanish, and their hearts would die within them as ſtones; it's kept up to their deluſion and ruine, by their abſtracting from, and non-reflecting upon the unſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and irrelevancy of the Grounds thereof: but the more the grounds of this joy of the Godly be reflected on, conſidered and ſearched into, they are found to be the more
<pb facs="tcp:179825:9"/> able to bear the Higheſt Superſtructures of their joy. <hi>Tenthly,</hi> It is ſuch a fellowship, that whatever meaſure of it be attained by ſojourning Saints, It wakeneth deſires, sharpeneth appetite, and ſtirreth up kindly longings for more, and yet more of it, even till it be compleated: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, and his great favourite, <hi>whom he knew face to face,</hi> when admitted to very much familiar fellowship with him, and is told, <hi>that he had found Grace in his ſight, that he knew him by name,</hi> And that at his earneſt deſire <hi>his preſence ſhould go with him, Exod. 33.12, 13, 14.</hi> Yet ſaith he to the Lord, verſ. <hi>18. I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory:</hi> So Holy <hi>Job</hi> Gods darling, <hi>whoſe candle ſhined on his head, by whoſe light he walked through darkneſs,</hi> and on <hi>whoſe Tabernacle the Secret of God was,</hi> Yet with much Holy longing, cryes, <hi>Chap. 23.3. Oh that I knew where I might find him, I would come even to his ſeat;</hi> and comforts himſelf amidſt all his Sorrows with the aſſured hope of the fully Satisfieing ſight and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Redeemer at the latter day: So likewiſe the Spouſe in the <hi>Song,</hi> who had often been brought into the Banquetting houſe, having the Banner of her beloveds love ſpread over her, whoſe left hand had lain often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her head, and whoſe right hand had em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>raced her; who had often ſitten down under his shadow with great delight, and found his fruis ſweet to her taſte: whoſe Spike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard did ſend forth the ſmell thereof, while the King ſat at his Table: who had frequently found by the kiſſes of his mouth, his love to be better then Wine, and to whom he had often given his loves in the Vineyards: Yet cryes in the concluſion of that High Song, <hi>make haſte</hi> (or flee) <hi>my Beloved, and be thou like to a</hi> Roe <hi>or to a young</hi> Hart <hi>on the mountains of Spices:</hi> So was it alſo with <hi>David the man according to Gods heart,</hi> who had much
<pb facs="tcp:179825:9"/> ſweet Communion with him in his wandrings and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs condition, in Caves and Dens of the Earth, and had often ſeen his Power and his Glory in the Sanctuary: Yet pants and breaths after more fellowship with him, even as the chaſed Hart doth after the water brooks, and cryes, <hi>when shall I come and appear before God? Pſal. 42.</hi> So in like manner, was it with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Chriſts great Minion, who beſide all the good dayes he had in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing Goſpel Ordinances, in planting and watering Churches, in converting and edifieing multitudes of Souls, in his triumphing, by making manifeſt the ſavour of Chriſts knowledge, had been raviſhed into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, caught up into Paradiſe and heard there unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able words, that were not lawful or posſible to be uttered: Yet as if he had never been with him, deſired <hi>to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and to be with Chriſt as beſt of all,</hi> and groans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, longing to <hi>be abſent from the Body and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord:</hi> And thus was it, finally, with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> the <hi>Beloved Diſciple,</hi> who had often lyen in his ſweet Maſters boſom, and could confidently ſay, <hi>Truly our Fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> cloſeth his <hi>Revelations</hi> with that Holily Pasſionat deſire, <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt</hi> it is ſuppoſed here, that in this ordinance of the Lords Supper there is a ſpecial eminencie, excellencie dignitie and worth; or, this Ordinance of the Lords Supper, is of a ſingular Solemn nature: and this I gather partly from this <hi>verſe</hi> conſidered in it ſelf, <hi>He
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179825:13"/> that Eats and Drinks unworthily,</hi> implies that there is a ſpecial worthineſs in it, that a man ſhould not offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty to; and partly from the connexion of this <hi>verſe</hi> with the former, for it is made a reaſon why he preſſes particular and ſtrict Self-examination, which ſhews that there is a more ſingular excellencie in this ordinance then in others: and partly from the context, for every Circumſtance ſpeaks out a Solemnity in this Ordinance, as 1. The night when it was inſtituted, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23 <hi>The ſame night in which he was betrayed,</hi> and when he was taking his goodnight of his Diſciples, 2. His jealouſie of, and his quarrelling and threatening for the abuſe of this Ordinance, Speaks out a ſpeciall excellencie in the Ordinance; that all who approach thereunto ſhould be ſuitably affected with: all the ordinances of the Lord are excellent: for if all his works be excellent, Then much more the Goſpel-ordinances, as being a ſtep above thoſe: and yet this ordinance of the Lords Supper ſeems dignified with an eminencie and excellencie above them all. 1. In reference to what it ſets out and exhibits: They all ſet out love, but this ſets out love in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree: for it ſets forth the Lords Death, wherein the moſt eminent ſtep and degree of his Love ſhines, Yea this Ordinance ſets out his actual dieing, and ſo ſets out his Love in its Livelieſt Colours, and as the great Maſter-piece of it. 2. In reſpect of the excellent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits communicated in it; It is true, there is no other thing on the matter communicat in it, then there is Communicat in the word and Baptiſme, Yet if we look to the words, <hi>Take ye, eat ye, this is my Body,</hi> They hold out Chriſt Jeſus not ſo much giving any Particular gift, as actually conferring himſelf in his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; And the main ſcope being to conferr Chriſt and all that is in him to the Believer, It holds out ſome way
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179825:13"/> the excellencie of this ordinance beyond others. 3. In reſpect of the manner how our Lord Jeſus makes over himſelf; whereby I mean not only the clearneſs of his making over himſelf for in this ordinance there is the cleareſt view of a ſlain Saviour, and of Covenanting wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h God; and often the moſt comfortable manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Love go alongſt with it, for which cauſe its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eminently <hi>the Communion;</hi> But alſo that there is here a clear glance of Heaven upon earth, Jeſus Chriſt and his People mixing (to ſpeak ſo) and being fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar together; he condeſcending not only to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them, but to be their food and refreſhment: and he giving them not only the word to their faith, but himſelf (as it were) to their ſenſe: in ſo far as the mean whereby He communica eth himſelf is more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: It is by his Spirit that the mean is made effectual: and there is not only a fixedneſs of Faith on ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Part but a ſort of Divineneſs in the ordinance it ſelf: the very Firſt fruits of Heaven being communicat, as it were, to the very ſenſes of the Believer: <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> (ſayes the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26 29.) <hi>I will not Drink henceforth of the Fruit of the Vine, until that day, I Drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome;</hi> where he ſeems to point out a more ſpeciall way of keeping communion with his people in this Ordinance, in reſemblance to that which he will have with them in heaven: There being here a more ſpeciall union and communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the head and members ſealed up, a type of that which is to be in Heaven, A taſte whereof is ſometimes given in this ordinance of the Communion: hence, its not only called the <hi>Communion,</hi> as in the foregoing <hi>Chapter, but the communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Table of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Uſe</hi> of it ſerves to let us ſee how much we

And what mean could have been invented, that could have mo e confirmed and warmed the hearts of his people then this, which is ſo lively a repreſentation and Commemoration of his Bleſſed Body? very like we might come to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſecond <hi>Uſe,</hi> ſerves to Provoke us to ſtudie to be in a Solemn Divine Heavenly frame, for ſuch a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Divine Heavenly action as this is: and thorowly to examine our ſelves, and to ſee that all things be in good order: like to a bride that is to be Married to morrow, who will be trying on her marriage cloathes, and ſeeing that all things be right. I ſhal not deſcend to particulars, but in <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> words in the general, only point at ſuch a frame as we conceive is called for from you. 1. It ſhould be ſuch a frame as ye would deſire to be in, if Chriſt were coming perſonally and viſibly to Marrie you to morrow: and O!

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179825:14"/> perſonally and viſibly, Studie and ſeek after ſuch a frame. 2. It ſhould be ſuch a frame as we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have if we were going to give up the Ghoſt, when all earthly things will be inſignifi ant and of little worth to us: even ſuch a Frame as if our eternal Peace and happineſs were depending on that chock, This would be the night of making our Teſtament (as it were) and of the adjuſting our accounts with God and of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things to a Point betwixt him and us; other wayes our debt may increaſe and grow greater, and it will not be ſo eaſie for us to win to a diſcharge of it. 3. It ſhould be ſuch a frame as we would deſire to be found in, if the day of Judgement were coming, and if that day were to be to morrow: O! how humble, how abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the things of a preſent world, and how confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Faith of Gods love, would we ſtudy to be, If the voice of the Arch angel, and of the laſt Trumpet were ſounding, and a Solemn meeting of all before the Tribunal of Chriſt were preſently to be? what a frame (I ſay) would ye deſire to be in in ſuch a caſe? Even ſuch a frame ſhould ye ſtudy to be in this night as ye would deſire to be found in, In that day: We fear it will be to many then a Prick and a ſting in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences within them, That they made ſo little Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be in a ſuitable frame for this ſo Solemn an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A Second reaſon may be drawn not only from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Graces and Duties, that is required in this action; But from the Nature of the thing it ſelf, that calls for Duties in a high Degree of Spirituality; if any o dinance or Duty call for a Spiritual f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what is the right way of partaking of it? there would be found but very little diſtinctneſs in the thing, and many content themſelves to live without clearneſs about it: And this makes people incapable to go about it aright. A Fourth reaſon is from Peoples loathneſs to beſtir themſelves in the wo k of Preparation for it; There is ſome Self examination requiſite for every Duty, but there is a more Solemn Self examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation injoyned in reference to this; and how very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant are we to it? And ſeeing examination of our ſelves is as the door, and entry to this Duty, is it any wonder that moſt Perſons Communicat unworthily?

            <p>The <hi>Firſt Uſe</hi> Serves for warning as to this matter; It is eaſie to get a Token and to come to the Table, but it is not ſo eaſie <hi>To Eat and Drink worthily,</hi> not ſo eaſie, <hi>to diſcern the Lords Body</hi> and to get Chriſt himſelf in the ordinance: and in a word ſo to go about partaking of the Lords Supper, as ye may have ſolid quietneſs of mind in reflecting on it: Is it not a wonder then that the moſt part doe ſo ſecurely and in a manner even deſperatly ruſh upon it, who have it may be lyen, ſome Ten, ſome Twenty, ſome thirty years without trouble under this guilt? We would think it a good piece of Preparation, if ye were Seriouſly afraid to become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>of the Body and Blood of the Lord:</hi> want of this holy fear breeds ſecurity and keeps from ſtirring up to dutie, and from reflecting on our ſelves: whereas if the heart

               </gap> your Preparation; even that ye may come knowing well what ye need, and what ye are to Receive if ye come aright.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> and main <hi>Uſe</hi> is, that ſeeing there is ſo great ground to fear Communicating unworthily, and that ſo great Judgements follow upon it, it would be, as our fear to Communicat unworthily, So our uptaking buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how we may communicat worthily; This is the end of the day, and ſhould be our task, and work this night, even to endeavour to be worthy communicants to morrow: Ye will readily ask how is ſuch a Frame to be attained and come by? I would, for anſwer, deſire you ſeriouſly to mind what ye have heard on theſe words, <hi>Let a man Examine himſelf and ſo let him eat,</hi> Which comprehend the Summe of what is called for from you; and we ſhal now add theſe <hi>Four</hi> things, that in your preparing your ſelves to Communicat Rightly and worthily, ye would ſeriouſly mind, 1. A right uptaking of your ſelves. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Right uptaking of the Ordinance. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A right Acting in reference to both. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A right manner of Acting, or a right Frame in your going about the work. For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſay, there would be a right uptaking of our Selves, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:179825:19"/> we may know what we are, what are our Sins, Spiritual wants and neceſſities, that we may have ſome diſtinct errand to God; This is implyed in theſe Words. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf;</hi> That he may be well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with himſelf: if there be not ſome time taken for attaining to a right Conſideration of our Selves, we cannot come rightly to thi O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dinance: or if any word come that ſuits our condition it will come by gueſſe as to us, and we may come to the Communion, and neither know what we need, not what we are ſeeking or would be at.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Second:</hi> We ſay, there would be a right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the ordinance it ſelf, which when wanting it mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es us, that we know not how to Communicat: in the ordinance we would take up the ſubſtance of it, the end of it, and how it effectua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the end. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Subſtance of the ordinance is Chriſt Jeſus himſelf, who though he be not bodily, yet is he really preſent in the Sacrament; His words are not empty words, the Signes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> empty Signes; But <hi>the Bread is his Body, and the wine is his Blood:</hi> For if there be a preſence in the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, as he makes it known through his Spirit, by the efficacie of it on the Heart; then in a more ſpeciall and Solemn manner, there is a preſence in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which alſo he makes ſenſible, to the Spiritual ſenſes of the Believer <hi>Secondly,</hi> The end and uſe of the Ordinance for which God hath appointed it, would alſo be rightly taken up; and this is large. It ſerves for the man feſting of his love in his Death till he come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and this would be a piece of your exerciſe to deſcover the love of Chriſt in it, and to put your faith to exerciſe on that love: In which reſpect Chriſtians have not only their Particular caſe to look to in the Sacraments, But alſo that their Spirits be taken up with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179825:19"/> the thoughts of the wonderfully condeſcending love of Chriſt, who hath given and left behin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> him a token and Memoriall of it: and eſpecially theſe ends would be looked to and conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> That its given for our inſtruction, for it gives us a Sight o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt crucified; It ſhewes us the way of making up our union with him, and the neceſſity of it, and the warand given us to make uſe of him: and as its given for inſtruction and teaching ſo for ſealing and confi ming; the Lord would have us the eby knowing the truth of his Promiſes and covenant for our greater conſolation, and that we may with greater liberty apply them: even as when a Prince of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers peace to a Rebel and grants him a Pardon, to make him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>e, and to remove all doubts and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies there is a ſeal appended to the Pardon, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes it, and conſequen ly ſtrengtheneth the Faith of the Rebel to reſt upon it: So this is a ſpecial end of the Sacrament to Seal and confirme: God having graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condeſcended to Covenant and Promiſe, and to Swear to the truth of his Covenant and p omiſe, <hi>That the Heirs of Promiſe may have ſtrong conſolation,</hi> He alſo appends ſeals to his Covenant. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to conſider how it effectua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s theſe ends: and thus we are to look on the Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Jeſus Chriſt and his Benefits: which muſt needs be a ſpiritual and Sublime thing, holden out in theſe words. <hi>Take ye, eat ye, this is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. Where we have Jeſus Chriſt giving over himſelf to the Believer, ſo as he and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever become one, and he ha h Chriſt to feed upon: Its true there is no Phyſicall conjunction here: Yet as in the word, the offer and promiſes conveigh Chriſt holden out in the Promiſes to the Soul, being received by fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, there is an union thus made up betwixt Chriſt and the Perſon: So in the right partaking of the Sacrament, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179825:20"/> Spirit go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng along with the word and Seal, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever receiving the Seal as given him of God for that end, as well as the word: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e reſults an union and Communion, a myſtical and Spiritual uniting and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt and the believer together: Which although it doth not alwayes neceſſarily preſuppoſe Faith going before, yet it ſuppoſes Faith neceſſarily to go along with it: and in this there is moſt expreſſe covenanting and bargaining betwixt Chriſt and the Believer, Jeſus Chriſt not giving himſelf here indefinitly, as he doth in the word and offer of the Goſpel, but particularly: and thus the Believers Faith hath the moſt diſtinct ground and reaſon to make application of him, and ſo the more diſtinct confirmation.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Third,</hi> there is a right acting in reference to both the former to be looked to, 1. There is ſomething that our Judgement and memory would be taken up with, which is as the key to what follows: we are to remember the Lords Death, the end of it: the love he had in dying: and his inſtituting of this ordinance when he died for this end, that we might remember his death and love therein, till he come again; and have our minds meditating on theſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There would be the exerciſe of our Graces, as of repentance, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on our ſelves; of love from looking to Chriſt, and of continued ſpiritual mourning reſulting from bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h; &amp; eſpecially there would be the exerciſe of Faith as being the main thing that on our part makes up the union, and whereby our Communion is entertained: and there is a <hi>threefold</hi> act of Faith called for in worthy Communicating, 1. An act receiving, 2. An act giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 3. A ratifieing act, that knits both the acts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 1. I ſay an act of Faith receiving Chriſts word and ordinance, and himſelf therein. 2. An act of faith
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:179825:20"/> giving, reſigning or committing our ſelves to him: the covenant being in this reſpect mutual. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a ratifieing act coupling or knitting theſe together, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt giving himſelf to us and our giving our ſelves to him, his ingagement to us and ours to him: To clear theſe a little further, <hi>Firſt</hi> the receiving act of faith looks to the inſtitution and covenant to which the Sacrament is appended, and to Chriſt in the words of inſtitution and in the Covenant, making offer of himſelf; Which is to be conſidered as in the word and covenant, to which the Sacrament is appended, and accordingly it welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, as it doth in the word; for as there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving act of Faith as to the Word, So there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving act of Faith as to the Sacrament; That is, when the Soul is put to diſpute whether about the offer if it be made to it, or about the Promiſe that ſuppoſes the condition, if it may lay hold upon it; The Believing ſouls taking of the Sacrament, is the permitting and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of it ſelf to be confirmed by vertue of Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing that ordinance for its confirmation, that the offer is made to it, and that the Promiſe belongs to it in particular: as when a penitent ſinner comes to the Communion, and that promiſe rolls in his thoughts, <hi>Thy ſins and thy iniquities will I remember no more,</hi> and he would fain believe it; the receiving act of Faith is to take the Sacrament as Gods putting his Seal to that word of p omiſe that he will make it good to the ſoul in particular. <hi>Thy ſins and thy iniquities will I remember no more:</hi> Or when a Soul hath its ſecret longing after Chriſt, and cannot diſpenſe with the want of him, and cryes out, <hi>O! When wilt thou come unto me?</hi> In the Sacrament it lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks on the inſtitution and takes it as a Seal of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>firmation to put it out of queſtion, that he that hath promiſed to come, <hi>will come and will not tarry,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:179825:21"/> and it looks on Chriſt giving the Communion, as if it ſaw him taking the pen, and with his own hand Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the contract, and layes it up in its heart as in a Charter Gueſt, as an evidence and confirmation of its right to Chriſt: and indeed there is much need of being diſtinct in this; for there are many who make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly faith in and dependance on God for preparation, and for a ſuitable frame; for gaining new ground of corruptions, for more humility and tenderneſs, for more thorow turning to the Lord; <hi>Convert me</hi> (ſayes <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31.) <hi>And I shal be converted,</hi> there would be many Serious and Sincere reſolutions, engagements, and purpoſes, and much heart-melting, and Prayer in the making of them, as it was with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah Jer.</hi> 50.5. Whoſe great deſire and deſigne was, to have the Covenant betwixt God and them ſo ſecured, that it might hold perpetually and never any more be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, they deſired to keep (as we uſe to ſpeak) no bank in their own hand, they allow of no reſervations or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and they go about this great work Praying and weeping: This were a Sweet and ſuitable frame for a Communion, and notably well becoming a people that Approach to the Lords Table; and we ſeriouſly commend it to you, and you to the grace of God in the Practiſe of theſe things, which his own bleſſed ſelf make forthcoming to you.</p>

            <p>IT is a very great and grave, a very Momentous and concerning work, rightly to partake of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; it hath as many and great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, attending the due and worthy Participation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179825:22"/> and as many ſad conſequences following the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Participation of it, as any other of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt hath; and therefore when the Apoſtle hath ſharpely expoſtulated with the Chriſt an <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for ſeveral abuſes in reference to this Ordinance; he proceeds, after a full declaration of its inſtitution, to guard them againſt all after abuſe thereof, and to fit and prepare them for ſuitable and worthy communicating; And the <hi>firſt</hi> direction that he gives them is in reference to preceeding Preparation, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> is, in reference to the action it ſelf, teaching them to communicat worthily, So as they may <hi>diſcern the Lords Body,</hi> by holding out the danger of unworthy Communicating; both which he knits together, telling them, that if any of theſe things be wanting, it will bring on Judgement. Whence in a word, and but in paſſing, we may <hi>Obſerve</hi> theſe two things. 1. That a man will never Communicat worthily, that doth not before hand indeavour to prepare himſelf for it; And therefore he prefixeth this, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> and then ſubjoins, <hi>And ſo let him Eat.</hi> 2. That a man that is not diſtinct in diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himſelf in ſome meaſure after the examination of himſelf, will never aright diſcern the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ords Body in this Ordinance of the Communion; He that takes not up himſelf, will never take up Chriſt rightly.</p>
            <p>In the words more particularly we have <hi>Three</hi> great things in reference to preſent Communicating; The 1. whereof is, the great and peculiar uſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and that is, that it makes the Lords body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, It puts Chriſt in a capacitie (to ſpeak ſo) to be taken up and diſcerned; The <hi>Second</hi> is, the great duty of a worthy Communicant; and that is, rightly to diſcern the Lords Body, ſo holden forth. The <hi>third</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:179825:23"/> is, the great Sin that unworthy Communicants fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and that is, <hi>They do not diſcern the Lords Body;</hi> but are like ſo many Dogs and Swine, who not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what delicats are there, they goe about the action, not knowing what they are doing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is clear, That in the Sacrament, Chriſt Jeſus his broken body is made diſcernible to us; elſe he would not find fault with them who come, and do not diſcern it; The words al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To clear this a litle further, we ſhal <hi>Firſt</hi> Premit a <hi>two fold</hi> diſtinction, and then. <hi>Secondly</hi> anſwer a few Queſtions that ſerve for clearing the Doctrine, and for better uptaking of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, we would <hi>diſtinguish</hi> betwixt theſe two <hi>viz:</hi> Looking on the Sacrament as ſtrictly taken, and as contradiſtinguiſhed from the word; and looking on it as more complexly taken, as including the word; It is in the laſt ſenſe that we conſider the Sacrament here, <hi>viz:</hi> as taking in, 1. Chriſt ſignified and repreſented by the elements, 2 The word and Covenant to which the Sacrament as a Seal is appended; Therefore the cup is called <hi>The Cup of the New Teſtament:</hi> 3. The ſeal of the Sacrament it ſelf appended to the word and Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We would <hi>diſtinguish</hi> betwixt Chriſts broken
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:179825:23"/> Body conſidered as diſcernible to our underſtanding only; and the ſame conſidered as it is diſcernible to our very ſenſes, or as it is apprehenſible, when by feeling we may grip it as it were; and not only look to it, but take hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of it: (how this is, ſhal be more Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly explained and cleared afterward for preventing of miſtakes,) it is in this laſt ſenſe that we underſtand <hi>diſcernible</hi> here, not excluding the former; ſo that Chriſts broken body in the Sacrament is not only made diſcernible to the underſtanding of the right communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, but he is made Communicable and apprehenſible, and there is an union with him attainable in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and what we ſaid before proves this: he holds out His Body to be received, And He is received in it.</p>
            <p>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the Second, to wit, The <hi>Queſtions</hi> to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; they are theſe <hi>Four.</hi> 1. In what reſpect is Chriſt preſent and diſcernible in the Sacrament? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly to what is he made diſcernible and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable? Thirdly how the Sacrament makes him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible, and what way it holds him out as diſcernible to us? Fourthly what may be the reaſons why Chriſt holds out himſelf, His broken Body, as diſcernible to us in the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, in what reſpect is Chriſt preſent and diſcernible in the Sacrament? We <hi>anſwer,</hi> firſt, not ſimply conſidered as he is the Son of God, nor in reſpect of any benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from him as media<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or, neither ſimply as Redeemer; But he is holden out as incarnat, and ſo this Sacrament differs from the <hi>Jews Paſſover,</hi> which held him out as to come, while this holds him out as come. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it holds him out not only as become man, but as ſuffering, as having his Body broken. <hi>Thirdly</hi> He is made diſcernible in reſpect of the end for which He ſuffered, and had his Body broken and his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:179825:24"/> Blood ſhed; <hi>This is</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>my Body which is broken for you, This cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood shed for the remisſion of the ſins of many:</hi> to wit, of all the Elect; It holds out Chriſt Mediator, God-man ſuffering for us. Fourthly, It holds him out as Communicable and in capacity to be participat of, by us; Therefore its called the <hi>Communion of His body. Chap.</hi> 10.16. To tell us that we may be united to him, and made to ſhare of him; and we are bidden <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>Eat</hi> and <hi>all</hi> to <hi>drink</hi> of it: Theſe laſt <hi>two</hi> look to the Covenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and hold out the Sacrament in reference to it, and how our Lord Jeſus, Firſt by his ſufferings was to purchaſe a People to himſelf, and Secondly that he was to be Communicable to his People; therefore <hi>the Cup</hi> is called <hi>the New Covenant in his Blood;</hi> The Cup and the Covenant go together: For though we may conſider Chriſt without the Sacrament; yet we cannot ſo well conſider the Sacrament without Chriſt and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To what is Chriſt made diſcernible and Communicable? We anſwer: Firſt he is not diſcernible nor preſent after a corporal manner to the bodily eye, though he be really and truely preſent; The bread that he gives is his Body, and the Cup his Blood, and yet it was Bread and wine which was given, and not his Body and Blood corporally. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Communicable by any local mutation, by taking us up to heaven to him, or by bringing his Body out of Heaven to us; But he is theſe <hi>three</hi> wayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Communicable; Firſt to our Spirituall ſenſes, to an enlightned underſtanding, which conſiders Chriſts Body broken and his Blood ſhed. Secondly, To the Faith of his people he is preſent in his own ordinance; when his ſpirit goes along and quickens their hearts, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:179825:24"/> their faith is in exerciſe. They are made to apprehend Chriſts Body, and to have an union with him ſitting in Glory as really as they partake of the elements with their hand and feed upon them with their mouth and ſtomach; an union as reall as is betwixt the head and the members, and betwixt the root and the branches: Theſe two, the <hi>Spirit</hi> on Chriſts ſide, and <hi>Faith</hi> on our ſide make up a reall union; and therefore though this preſence be real, yet it's Spirituall; Faith looking and going thorow the elements takes up Chriſt according to the end appointed; and this makes the union, even as fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h will look and go thorow the word and crediting the word, takes up Chriſt in it, and makes an union with him; ſo by vertue of this ordinance there is a Spiritual preſence of, and union with Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Thirdly</hi> A preſence to ſenſe, not ſo much in reſpect of inward feeling, as in reſpect of the powerful effects of his preſence, though often inward feeling goes alongſt with it; and therefore its called the <hi>Communion of his Body,</hi> and the <hi>wine of Heaven;</hi> And in reſpect of the mean and way he manifeſts himſelf therein, to the eye, to the touch, to the taſte, and to the ear, and there is a colour ſenſible: which is more then is in any other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, where there is but the exerciſe of one ſenſe; for the more of the outward ſenſes he makes uſe of, he brings with him a proportionable bleſſing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How doth the Sacrament hold out Chriſt as diſcernible to us? For anſwer I ſhal offer theſe <hi>Four</hi> wayes. How he may be preſent to the faith of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the Sacrament; all which wayes he is made diſcernible: 1 In reſpect of the inſtitution; for Chriſt is here repreſented by the Miniſter as giving himſelf; his authority and warrand is here; therefore himſelf is
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:179825:25"/> here: This though it be common to all Chriſts ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, yet it belongs in a peculiar way to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; for in it he is preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in a ſpecial man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over himſelf and his ſufferings to us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He is made diſcernible in the Sacrament in as far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents him: and though the word hold him out, yet the Sacrament doth ſo, more fully, clearly and ſenſibly, by ſuch and ſuch ſignes, by bread, and bread broken, repreſenting his Body broken by Suffering; by wine, and wine poured out, repreſenting his Blood ſhed: and by wine diſtinct from the bread, to ſhew a moſt true and reall death; In which reſpect it's ſaid, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me: and as often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye shew forth the Lords Death till he come again:</hi> Every Sacrament repreſents Chriſt, but this repreſents him in his ſuffering and dieing, and in the end of it: and makes it over to the worthie communicant, Thirdly he is made diſcernible by this Sacrament in this reſpect, as it's a ſeal appended and affixed to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſerving to ratifie and confirm the Promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Covenant, and ſo the Bread and wine, conſidered in reference to the inſtitution, are a real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of our real partaking of the thing ſignified, and in ſome reſpect make Chriſt really preſent: as the giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſealed Charter of a houſe to a man, is the giving him the houſe: or as the giving of infeofment by a bit of earth and ſtone (being a legall confirmation) is the giving of that land to the man, wherein he is infeoft: becauſe (as I ſaid) it's a legall right to it, and makes it preſent and diſcernible to him: even ſo Chriſt is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e diſcernible in this ordinance, becauſe we have our right to him which is in the word, in a ſpecial manner, confirmed to us in it: for not only doth this (as other Sacraments do) confirm the word and Covenant in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:179825:25"/> general, but it hath this peculiar to it, that it confirms Chriſts making over his dieing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to us. Fourthly Chriſt is here preſent and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cernible, and made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o by this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; if we conſider the Sacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as a mean whereby we have Chriſt Communicat to us, he not only makes over himſelf Covenant wiſe: but ſealeth this gift: and the Sacrament is a mean of Communion with him thus made over to us: in which reſpect the believer doth and may warrantably make uſe of the Sacrament, for his quickening, elevating, and ſtrengthening to cleave cloſer, and to grip faſter to Chriſt: for which cauſe it's called the <hi>Communion of his Body:</hi> and hereby we are ſaid to be made <hi>one Body with him:</hi> Not but that without the Sacrament it may be and is often ſo: but by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Union and Communion is ſtrengthened and furthered to the faith, and Spiritual ſenſe of the believer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, what are the reaſons why Chriſt will have his broken Body made thus diſcernible and apprehenſible in this Sacrament? We anſwer, that he will have it ſo for theſe reaſons. Firſt for evidencing of and bearing Teſtimony to his great love to his People; It ſayes that a dieing Chriſt ſo loves us that he gave himſelf to us; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the memorie of his death is revived and kept up; He will have his dieing ſelf, in a Sacrament beſtowed on his People, to keep his love ſtill freſh to them in their remembrance. Secondly for the Publick Profeſſing and teſtifying our faith in a dieing Saviour; For in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament we profeſs our Faith in him, and dependence on him; and we ſay thereby and declare to the world, this my Saviour died, and is able to give me life; which is a piece of Honour and Glory to the Mediator, and a part of our dutie; when we give Publick teſtimonie, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:179825:26"/> we think no ſhame of a crucified Redeemer. Thirdly, The Lord hath, for the edification and benefit of his People, made himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o diſcernible in this Sacrament; and there is a <hi>Fourfold</hi> edification o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> benefit that redounds to them by it. Firſt inſtruction, for they that cannot ſo well take up the Lord in the word, may be ſome-what helped to take him up in the Sacrament as a ſlain Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and as being as needfull as meat and drink, without which, as we cannot live, no more can we live without him: and O! how manie Spiritual leſſons may be ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by theſe ſignificant ceremonies inſtituted by Chriſt? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly There is here edification unto the faith of Gods Peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e: and thus it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>comes ſtrengthening, when not only Chriſt ſayes in his word, <hi>I have loved my Church, and given my ſelf for her, and they that believe ſhal not periſh;</hi> but we have his ordinance Sealing this: Its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſtrengthening to a poor weak doubting body which could not eaſily believe, that Chriſt would be ſo kind to a rebell; when he gets a ſacred Seal of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it helps to Believe what is promiſed. Thirdly It edifies as it ſerveth to promote the inward growth of Grace, for in the Sacrament Chriſt is Communicat: and as he is Communicat, life is Communicat, love to God, and to one another is Communicat: and in a word we cannot Imagine a Communication of Chriſt; but it brings with it ſtrengthening to the inward man. Fourthly there is edification in reſpect of the believers conſolation, whether as, to his Senſe, or as to his Faith; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in its offer and Promiſes comes out and ſayes, men and women, be it known to you, that Chriſt is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eached to you and remiſſion of ſins thorow him; But the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſayes, Believing man and woman, there is my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:179825:26"/> Body not only broken for all the Elect in generall, but for thee in particular: and this much ſilenceth the great debate whether I be elected or not, or within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or not; for it ſayes, O Man, here is a ſlain and broken Redeemer made over unto thee upon condition that thou cloſe with him in the Covenant, as he offers himſelf: and ſo when there has been ſome wavering and fainting in reſpect of conſolation before, it proves very ſtrengthening of the Believers conſolation, conſidering the nature of the Ordinance: and in this reſpect the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is as a Love-token of a kind Husband to his Spouſe, who when he is to remove to ſome conſiderable diſtance from her for a time, ſayes, take and keep this in remembrance of me, and think that I dearly love thee and will not forget thee, till we meet again.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Point of Doctrine is, the great duty called for from a worthy Communicant, and that in ſhort is, rightly to diſcern the Lords Body made ſo diſcernible, and as he is made diſcernible: The Text confirmes the Doctrine: for though a man had never ſo many good things, Suppoſe that he had not only gifts but Grace, yea and a Holy frame of Spirit, yet if he be ignorant of what he is called to or a doing in this Ordinance, he cannot diſcerne the Lords Body, and ſo cannot Communicat worthily: Hence it is that there is ſo much need of Knowledge, without which a man can no more then a child or a fool rightly take up Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>To open this a litle we ſhal ſpeak a word to theſe three, 1. To the Object to be diſcerned. 2. To the act of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning. 3. To the reaſons why this diſcerning is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> for the <hi>Object to be diſcerned,</hi> It is Chriſt Jeſus,

               </gap> exerciſing himſelf in reference to his need, and that ordinance appointed for ſupply of his need by Jeſus Chriſt: which is with a reflex look ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on himſelf, ſometimes on Chriſt. And there are in this theſe <hi>five</hi> ſteps which follow one of them upon another. 1. It conſiſts in a ſuitable frame of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:179825:28"/> heart, as becomes ſuch a poor ſinful unworthy and needy perſon in the preſence of ſo Holy a Lord, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about ſuch a Holy action: another frame then is called for at our dinner or Supper, or at ordinary hearing the word, or at Prayer: A holy, humble, cheerfull, ſerious, Heavenly and hungry frame: Holy awe and reſpect to God making humble, Faith of Gods goodneſs and rich Grace in Chriſt ſhining in this Ordinance, making cheerful: The convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of need making Sober, and yet very ſerious and eager in what he is about: It's a frame made up, as it were, of contrarieties: ardent love and zeal, and yet a calme and compoſed Spirit to hear what God ſayes, To take what he gives, and to behold what he manifeſts. 2. It conſiſts in an exerciſe of the mind in meditation, both in reference to our ſelves and to Chriſt: Meditation in reference to our own ſinfulneſs and miſery: and meditation on Chriſts love: calling to mind all that he hath done: thinking with delight on Chriſts ſuffering and on the end of it, and again reflecting a look on our ſelves to keep life in this meditation, what was I, when he ſuffered and did all this for me? and what am I now, when he is offering this to me? To have the picture of a loving Husband hanging by a wife to what purpoſe is it, and for what uſe doth it ſerve, if ſhe never look on it to mind him whom it repreſents? 3. It conſiſts in an exerciſe of Graces, It's even (as it is laid in the Song) a making of all the Spices to caſt forth their ſmell: and the putting of all things in good order and ſtudying to have them in good caſe:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:179825:28"/> It's to have love warm to the giver, and cloſing with the gift of a dieing Saviour, and to have love warm to others of his people for his ſake, and becauſe he hath taken us in with others, to partake of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his love ſhining in his Death: for love to the head and members, go together: It's to have repentance lively ſtirred up &amp; ſin made heart-prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Godly ſorrow to flow: the heart made to loath it: and the mind exerciſed in forming hearty reſolutions, Purpoſes, vows, and engagements againſt it: but it's eſpecially to have faith ſtirred up and in exerciſe, and to have all the ſenſes of Faith (to ſpeak ſo) ſet a going: as when the word comes out and ſayes <hi>Take ye, Eat ye, this is my Body, which is broken for you.</hi> Faith beholds and gets as clear and ſatisfieing a view of Chriſts Suffering and dieing, as if the man ſaw him with his Bodily eyes: when the hand is ſtretched out to take. Faith acts Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably in ſtretching out it's hand to take Chriſt, and not only grips him, but in this Ordinance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the end of it, takes it as a pledge of Chriſt performing what he hath promiſed, making uſe of him for the end appointed: when the eye looks on what is done, Faith is conſidering and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a view of Chriſt and of the covenant and of the benefits purchaſed by him, and ſees another thing then the elements, even the wakened up ſword of the Fathers juſtice purſueing the mediator, as the elects cautioner: when the eye looks on the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, Faith it ſees Chriſt made as it were believers Common-good given among them, and to every
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:179825:29"/> one of them: when the hand puts the bread and wine to the mouth, Faith hath a way of opening it's mouth and (as it were) chewing and feeding upon Jeſus Chriſt, and of ſtrengthening, refreſhing, and cheering it ſelf in him counting it ſelf well come to with him and ſecure in him, and faſtening it's engagements to him: all which ſtrengthen our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life, as eating and drinking doth the natural life: and then when it comes to the taſte, Chriſt reliſheth moſt ſweetly to the Believer, ſo that no Wine doth cheer the natural heart ſo much as Chriſt in the Sacrament conſidered in his love and Covenant, and in the benefits that come by him, do the Soul of the believer; Faith here conſiders Chriſt not only as communicable: but as actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. The fourth thing wherein this diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiſts, is a reflecting exerciſe, when we have received the Sacrament we are to reflect and conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what we have done, and what we are doing, are we indeed feeding upon Chriſt? What is this in our hands? This bread in ſome reſpect is not bread, but Chriſt; This cup is not Wine, but <hi>the cup of the New Teſtament in his Blood,</hi> and by this reflex act, the Believer applies, and confirmes himſelf, having received the Sacrament, whereby his union with Chriſt is ſignified and ſealed up, he applies and ſayes within himſelf, now Chriſt is mine, and I am his: and he confirmes himſelf in Chriſts love to himſelf and in his intereſt in him: Now ſayeth he, I have gotten no deluſion, but the ſigne and Seal of his bleſſed Body broken, and of his Blood ſhed for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:179825:29"/> me: If unbelief ſay, have ye gotten Chriſt indeed? Yes ſayes the Believers faith, having received this Pledge of his love, I have gotten himſelf and I ſhould Believe it; and this is to act on Chriſt not only directly, which is a thing common to the Sacrament with the word, but to act on Chriſt reflexly: and to perſwade our ſelves of our union and Communion with him, which is the end of this Ordinance: elſe we take not up Chriſt as giving a ſeal; Therefore the word is, <hi>Take, eat, This is my Body broken for you:</hi> there is more then a bare ſigne here: and faith acts not only for receiving, but for confirming it ſelf, that by receiving it hath an union and Communion with him, who is holden out in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, For if it be a ſeal and exhibit Chriſt as a ſeal, then faith ſhould receive and act on it as ſuch for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end that a ſeal ſhould have, ſuppoſing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to preceed. Fifthly, it conſiſts in an act of ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual affecting, when there is a Holy ſmacking (to ſpeak ſo) and kiſſing of Chriſt, The ſoul digeſting him for the life of the inner man, and thereon delighting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and exulting in him: and ſo the faith, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and hope of the Believer are ſtrengthened: which makes him that he is not aſhamed; and upon the back of this ordinarily the Love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart: and though there ſhould be little ſenſible feeling, yet the believer finds himſelf oblidged to cheer himſelf in Chriſt, and in the Covenant and in the benefits that he hath thorow his purchaſe: and there is readily ſome warming of love to Chriſt, and he is confirmed in the faith of the love of Chriſt to him: and it is impoſſible, where theſe two are, but ſome Holy tickling of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which flow from the Word and from this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thus rightly gone about (as has been ſaid) will follow: and if this be not, That is, if Chriſt be not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:179825:30"/> thus diſcerned in the Sacrament, 1. God gets not what he calls for, Chriſts death is not rightly minded, his Glory and our edification are not promoved, Nor 2. Is the end of the Sacrament attained: neither. 3. Is our comfort furthered: For its not the Ordinance barely, or Ordinary Bread and Wine ſet apart for a Holy uſe, But Jeſus Chriſt diſcerned and received in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that comforts; otherwiſe, the ordinance in and by it's ſelf will not promove our comfort and growth.</p>
            <p>The Third <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, that it is, though a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and rife, yet a very great ſin not to diſcern the Lords body as he is holden out in this Sacrament diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible; The greatneſs of which may be eaſily gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what we have diſcourſed concerning the great priviledge of the diſcernibleneſs of the Lords body therein; from the horridneſs of the guilt that it involves in, even <hi>the guilt of the body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> the greateſt and moſt horrid of all Blood guiltineſs; and from the dreadful Judgements and Plagues that follow on it, temporal or bodily, and Spiritual Plagues, yea even eternal Damna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, if Repentance through Grace prevent not: But we muſt, becauſe of the ſhortneſs of time, leave all that might be ſpoken in the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Proſecution of this Doctrine; and ſhall only give you <hi>Two or Three</hi> Caveats (wherewith I ſhall cloſe) to guard againſt miſtakes in reference to what hath been ſpoken; I know it will readily be ſaid, If this be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the Lords body, and if none other do diſcern it, but ſuch as go about theſe things, it will be hard for any to diſcern it. For anſwer to this I would have you to conſider, 1. That there is a more explicit, diſtinct and perfect diſcerning; and a more implicit, confuſed and indiſtinct diſcerning of the Lords Body: if we ſpeak of perfection in diſcerning; who come up to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179825:30"/> that? but if we ſpeak of an honeſt ſincere way of aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcern, though it be ſomewhat indiſtinct and confuſed, that may be won at; yea I would not think them in a good condition that reſt ſatisfied with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as being diſtinct enough in all theſe things whereof we have ſpoken; yet where there is (as I juſt now ſaid) honeſt aiming at theſe things, though in a confuſed and indiſtinct way; where faith and love are in ſome meaſure acting with a ſort of fear &amp; joy mixed together; when there is a fear to profane the ordinance, and yet the ſoul loves it ſo well that it cannot endure to want it, nor Chriſt in it, There is a diſcerning of the Lords Body that warrands to draw near. 2. Conſider, that there is a general confuſion and a particular confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (to ſpeak ſo) in going about this Ordinance: The general confuſion is this, when perſons are ſo very ignorant and confuſed, that they know not at all what they are doing: a Particular confuſion is only in ſome reſpect, that is when a Soul knoweth that Jeſus Chriſt is in the Ordinance, and knoweth its own condition to ſtand in need of him, that it hath many Spiritual wants to be ſupplied, and that there is much good and a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all thoſe wants to be had from Chriſt in this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but how to come at it thereby, it knows not ſo well nor ſo diſtinctly: A perſon that is confuſed in the generall cannot diſcern the Lords Body in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, But one that is confuſed in a particular, may: and though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſuch an one cannot, it may be, Pitch on a particular promiſe that ſuites his need, yet he may fix on Chriſt and on the covenant in general: which is one of the main things that Faith acts on: and indeed unleſs himſelf be acted on by Faith, his benefits fail: and though a ſerious Soul cannot get a particular promiſe to ſettle on, We ſay it ſhould ſtick by the Covenant in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:179825:31"/> general as including all particulars. 3. Conſider, the diſcerning is not to be aſtricted to the very inſtant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap> thoſe Similitudes ſhew what great and ſingular ſatisfaction is to be had in it, therefore its compared to a <hi>Feaſt, Supper,</hi> and <hi>Dinner,</hi> ſome of them ſhew the way how we are made Partakers of it: So <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> holds forth believing; and ſome of thoſe ſimilitudes hold forth both, as this of a <hi>Marriage,</hi> which points at the ſtrait union betwixt Chriſt and Believers, and at the manner or way of our entring into this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed union, on which follows Communion.</p>
            <p>We need not inſiſt in opening the Words, which are plain; we ſhall only ſay theſe <hi>two Words,</hi> to make way for <hi>Obſervations;</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof ſhal be, to ſhew that the ſcope of the Parable is not to hold forth Peoples coming to the Ordinances, or the Sacraments only or mainly; but their coming to Chriſt Jeſus himſelf and to the fat things in the Ordinances: Many come to the Ordinances who come not to Chriſt and to the feaſt: that which is called for here, is a real cloſing with Chriſt, and an accepting of him for our Husband, on his own
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:179825:32"/> terms: The ſecond word is, to ſhew that though the Ordinances be neither the Marriage nor the Feaſt, Yet it's by the Ordinances that the marriage is furthered and the Feaſt prepared and made ready? for Faith takes Chriſt in the word, and ſtrikes hands with him in the Sacrament, when he ſayeth in the Word, <hi>be thou for me and I will be for thee,</hi> Faith ſaith, content Lord, and when he ſaith in the Sacrament, <hi>Take,</hi> Faith ſayeth welcome with all my heart, He being there as well as he is in the Word.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>two</hi> things being premiſed, we ſhall <hi>firſt,</hi> at once and together Propoſe ſome Obſervations from the words. <hi>Secondly</hi> we ſhall clear and confirm them: and and then <hi>Thirdly</hi> we ſhall inſiſt in the application of all joyntly. The <hi>Obſervations</hi> are theſe. <hi>Firſt</hi> that in the Goſpel there is a clear and manifeſt making up of a Marriage betwixt Chriſt and Souls; The preaching of the Goſpel is like a mans making of a marriage for his Son. The ſecond is, that this marriage is one of the moſt excellent marriages that ever was: therefore its called the Marriage of the Kings Son. The <hi>Third</hi> is, that before this marriage can be brought about and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, there are many things to be made ready. The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, that where the Goſpel comes, all things are made ready for Souls cloſing with Chriſt in this marriage. The <hi>Fifth</hi> is, that the Maſter of the Feaſt the <hi>KING</hi> God the Father, and the <hi>Kings</hi> Son the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom are not only content and willing, but very deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to have ſinners coming to the Marriage, they would fain (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) have poor Souls eſpouſed to Chriſt. The <hi>Sixth</hi> is, that when the Maſter ſends out his ſervants in his name, their great work is to invite to the wedding and to cloſe the marriage. The <hi>Seventh</hi> is, that when People are invited to this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:179825:32"/> it is their duty and greatly of their concern to come. The <hi>Eighth</hi> is, that all they that come may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a very hearty welcome: therefore they are invited once and again: and if we compare this <hi>Text with Luke</hi> 14. We will find there, that the Maſter orders his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to <hi>Compel</hi> them that are invited to come in.</p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>Obſervations</hi> are very obvious in the Words; and if the Lord would <hi>Graciouſly</hi> pleaſe to help us to ſpeak and you to hear: as they are no unpertinent to our Preſent Purpoſe, So they might be made very edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, ſtrengthening, refreſhing and comfortable to us.</p>
            <p>We ſhall in the ſecond Place, a little more particularly clear and confirme every one of them. The <hi>Firſt</hi> was, that, There is a Marriage betwixt Chriſt and ſouls held forth and made offer of in this Goſpel. We take this for granted: for here is the <hi>Kings Son,</hi> and ſome bidden to his marriage, and thoſe that are bidden are not worthy: they are all Profeſſors &amp; members of the viſible Church, the ſcope of the Parable being to ſhew, that the offer of this Marriage was firſt made to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed to them, and then from them it came to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> I ſhall in paſſing give you a litle hint of the nature of this Marriage in theſe <hi>four:</hi> 1. There is by this Goſpel a real union made up betwixt Chriſt and the ſouls of Believers; Which union is not with the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, nor with ſenſe, nor with the Benefits which flow from Chriſt; but with Chriſt himſelf Primarily and Principally, and it is ſo near a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ye and very cloſe, that it is preferred unto and goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h beyond the union that is betwixt the Husband and Wife: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>Members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his bones,</hi> Where alluding to that union betwixt Husband and Wife, he not only makes the union reall, but makes the one much ſtraiter then the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:179825:33"/> other. Secondly the nature of this union is ſuch, that it is Mutual; the Bridegroom hath in a manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uall upgiving of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom to the Bride, and of the Bride to the Bridegroom; according to thoſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nderfully condeſcending words, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.3. <hi>Thou shalt not be for another man, So will I alſo be for thee:</hi> The Lord hath Believers under a peculiar tye to him, and he hath tyed himſelf Peculiarly to them, ſo that (if we may ſpeak thus) neither of them is Maſter of themſelves; The Lord Jeſus doth ſome way account himſelf not to be maſter of himſelf, he is ſo engaged to them to be theirs and for them; and cannot but be anſwerable to his engagemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and they are oblidged to be no more Maſters of themſelves, but to be abſolutlie and altogether at his diſpoſing. <hi>Thirdly</hi> this union is made up by mutuall conſent of Parties, and the conſent muſt be willing; His conſent comes in his Word; He ſays from thence, <hi>Behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man will hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me;</hi> I come, (as if he had ſaid) in my Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pel to <hi>woo,</hi> and if any will conſent to take me on the terms on which I offer my ſelf, I <hi>will be</hi> theirs: The ſouls conſent is given by Faith in his word, which is called <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>receiving of him,</hi> and is relative to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: The offer is indeed backed and quickned by the Spirit, without which it would never be received; yet notwithſtanding, that which our faith lays hold on, is not the Spirit, but the word quickened by the ſpirit. <hi>Fourthly</hi> conſider here the effects that follow immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inſtantly on this Marriage union, Chriſt with all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:179825:33"/> that is his becomes ours, and we with all that is ours become his; our debt is imputed to him, he is lyable to it and muſt pay i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Second Obſervation</hi> was, that this is a moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in this world whom ye can marry, that is ſo rich as He? They that Marry Him ſhall <hi>inherit all things Rev.</hi> 21.7. We may clear it a litle further from <hi>five</hi> or <hi>Six</hi> Particulars in the Text. 1. It's an excellent and honourable Marriage in reſpect of the Bridegroom who is, (as hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) The <hi>Kings Son,</hi> who hath not another natural Son, He is he <hi>only begotten of the Father?</hi> there is not another Mediator, He is the Fathers <hi>equall and fellow;</hi> So that if (if we may put an <hi>if</hi> to it) the Father be great and glorious, ſo is He, for He is God, the ſame God equal with the Father in Power and Glory; <hi>the wonderful Counſeller, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Secondly this Marriage is excellent and honourable in reſpect of the Brides <hi>Father in Law,</hi> (ſo to ſpeak) He is the <hi>King;</hi> God the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt have all a hand in it; and the Believer married to Chriſt is <hi>Daughter in law</hi> to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:179825:34"/> great God, ingrafted ſome way into the ſame ſtock, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed with the ſame family. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. <hi>I will be a Father to you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters ſayeth the Lord Almighty.</hi> Thirdly it's excellent and honourable in reſpect of the Preparation made for it. There was never ſuch a wedding Feaſt; the dinner is prepared, the oxen and Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lings killed: but you will ſay what is all that? Even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, He is that <hi>Bread indeed, that drink indeed; the feaſt of fat things and of wines on the lees well refined;</hi> the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom is (to ſay ſo) the chief diſh that the Believer feeds and lives upon for ever; and the Spirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and benefits that are gotten in him and from him, are as ſo many diſhes of this feaſt; ſuch as righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pardon of ſin, Peace, and friendſhip with God, the Spirit, Adoption, Sanctification, joy in the holy Ghoſt, grace and Glory, the hope of a Croum in thoſe manſions that are in his Fathers Houſe, of a ſeat with him at his Table and on his Throne; even a ſhare in his whole Purchaſe; and is not that a feaſt? Fourthly its Honourable and excellent in reſpect of its moſt noble riſe, <hi>viz.</hi> From all eternity, in the boſome of the Father, it bred (to ſay ſo) in the Kings breaſt before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World was laid; the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was then concluded, and the contract of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage there drawn, and the bleſſed Project of it then laid down; <hi>Sacrifices and Offerings thou didſt not deſire,</hi> (ſaith the Mediator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.) <hi>Mine ears hoſt thou opened, burnt offerings nor ſin offerings thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; Then ſaid I, lo I come, in the Volume of thy Book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God:</hi> The Father gives ſo many to the Son to be redeemed of whom he willingly readily, and cheerfully accepts, and offers to ſatisfie for them, which in due time he doth.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:179825:34"/> Fifthly, its excellent and honourable in this reſpect, That there was never ſuch a concurrence of ſo many and ſo great things to commend and further a marriage as there is in this; Such as the making of the World, men and Angels, the incarnation of Chriſt or his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, his Preaching and working of Miracles for confirmation of his doctrine, his ſuffering and dying, riſing and aſcending, his giving Miniſters and their gifts: and to make up the Marriage union, the Spirit from Heaven coming along with the word, and working faith in the Soul, by which bonds Chriſt &amp; the Believer are joined together; Chriſt by his Spirit apprehending the Believer &amp; the beliver apprehending Chriſt by Faith: was there ever a marriage contract or union bound up betwixt two ſuch vaſtly and infinitly diſtant Parties? was there ever ſuch honour and riches attending and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a match? ſuch righteouſneſs, remiſſion of ſin, Adoption, Peace with God, joy of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit, holineſs in the beginning and gradual advances of it, fellowſhip and walking with God, the White ſtone, the new Name, the Throne, the Crown, Grace, and Glory, every thing that is good, for the Bride here, and Glory in Heaven; In a word Jeſus Chriſt and all the benefits of his Purchaſe; were there ever ſuch eaſie termes and conditions? It's only, <hi>come to the Wedding;</hi> when the King comes a wooing, let him be welcomed with your hearts conſent; when he ſayes, <hi>I am content to marrie you, let your hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts ſay, Amen, Lord Jeſus, I am content to marrie thee, and to be for thee and for none other:</hi> and may not I add, was there ever ſuch ſecurity and confirmation given of any marriage? it's confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the death of the Bridegroom, he hath ſealed his Teſtament with his Blood, and there is no annulling nor altering of a mans Teſtament when he is dead; and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:179825:35"/> our Lord Jeſus who was once dead is now alive and lives for evermore, he will never die again, nor make another Teſtament: O! beloved hearers, all this is to let you ſee that our Lord is in earneſt and very willing to eſpouſe you: and indeed it ſhall not be his Fault, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it be not a bargain, and if it be indeed a bargain betwixt your ſouls and him, it's a very ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and rich one: O! the many rare, excellent, noble, notable and non-ſuch Priviledges and advantages that attend this marriage, and are to be enjoyed by the ſoul eſpouſed to Chriſt; even God and Chriſt, Grace and Glory and all that is comprehended under theſe belongs to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſoul: We muſt here be ſilent, leſt in ſpeaking of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they are, nay if all the ableſt and holieſt Miniſters on earth, all the Angels in Heaven were joyned together they could not to the full by very far, tell what an excellent match and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage this is, even to be matched with the Son of God; and yet this priviledge and honour have all the ſaints, all Believers, to whom he is <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>Precious,</hi> though alace! not as he ought to be; there is a day coming, when we ſhall know to ſatisfaction, <hi>that the Father is in the ſon, and the ſon in the Father; and that believers are in Chriſt and he in them;</hi> We ſhall then know the now in expreſſible and inconceivable advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of this marriage, <hi>When He shall come to be glorified in His Saints, and wond'red at in all them that believe:</hi> and till that day the one half will never be told us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third Obſervation</hi> was, that there are many things to be removed out of the way, and to be done: many things to be made ready before this marriage can be made up. 1. There is a naturall diſtance between the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:179825:35"/> Parties, that muſt be removed: God cannot be one fleſh with us: and betwixt Parties to be married, there muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:179825:36"/> for us who knew no ſin, and we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> For it was as really agreed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption that he ſhould be made ſin for us, as it came to paſs in the actual execution of it: and thus way is made for the marriage. <hi>Fourthly</hi> when this is done, the marriage muſt be proclaimed through the world by the Preached Goſpel, the contract muſt be opened up and read, and ſinners conſent called for; We are told therein, that <hi>the Word is made flesh and dwelt amongſt us,</hi> and becauſe <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son who is in the boſom of the Father, he declares him:</hi> as it is <hi>John</hi> 1.14, 15. He comes and reveals more clearly the contract, firſt in his own Perſon and by his own Miniſterie, and then by ſending his ſervants, and telling that all things are ready. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the laſt thing to be removed is the uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſtupidneſs of our hearts, naturally we are given to ſlight him in his offers, to refuſe to open to him, and to let him in, when he knocks, to make excuſe, to delay, ſhift and put him off, nay to refuſe to entertain his propoſal of Marriage, and to give him a repulſe: therefo e he comes by his Spirit, and puts in his finger by the hole of the door, and lets ſome <hi>Myrrhe</hi> drop on the handles of the lock, and powerfully but ſweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the heart to caſt it ſelf open to him; and then he performs the promiſes of Sanctification, <hi>Circumciſing the heart to love him with all the heart, and with all the Soul,</hi> as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. And all theſe promiſes are contrived, framed and provided to meet with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in us; we are told, <hi>John</hi> 6 44. <hi>That no man can come to Chriſt except the Father that ſent him draw him,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. It is Promiſed, <hi>that in the day of his Power His people shal be willing: and whoever</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made willing) <hi>cometh shall in no wiſe be caſt out, John</hi> 6.37.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:179825:36"/>
            <p>The Fourth <hi>Obſervation</hi> is, That by the Preaching of the Goſpel, whither ſo ever it cometh, and by the great things made offer of therein, all things are made ready; Obſtructions and what ever might hinder the cloſing of the Marriage are removed; the Father is ready, having declared his willingneſs to give his conſent; <hi>This is my beloved</hi> Son <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him, Matth.</hi> 3. I am well ſatisfied with him, take him to you for your head and husband: the Son is ready to take all by the hand that will embrace him: Pardon of Sin, Peace, with God, Sanctification, the manſion &amp;c: are ready to be beſtowed: the feaſt is ready, the fatlings are prepared; the Promiſes are filled with every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary good thing, there <hi>is bread enough in the Prodigals fathers houſe and to ſpare:</hi> the contract is ready, and an offer of it made on the Bridegrooms ſide: the terms are drawn up and put in Form, and all things agreed upon and ready, even to the Subſcription: and there is no more required, but that the hearers of this Goſpel hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly conſent to take him, and ſubmit to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dominion: which if they do, all things ſhall be theirs, even life eternal, and all things that may fit them for it, Promiſes for this life and that which is to come, and Chriſt engaged to keep the bargain: and this is it that is preached every day to you, though, alace! unſuitably: ſo that it's not now, <hi>Who shall go up to Heaven and bring down Chriſt from above?</hi> or <hi>Who shall deſcend unto the deep, and bring him up from the dead?</hi> That we may get him to Marry: <hi>but the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> ſaith the word, <hi>is near thee even in thy mouth,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſts conſent is not to be asked or brought from afar, for he hath declared it in his word, and the terms of the contract are, <hi>if thou shalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and shalt believe with thy heart, that God hath

               </gap> God and ſinners are ready</p>
            <p>The Fifth <hi>Obſervation</hi> was, that Chriſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom &amp; his Father are very willing to have the match made up and the marriage compleated: therefore doth he ſend forth his ſervants with a ſtrict commiſſion, not only to tell ſinners that all things ready, but to bid them come to the Marriage: yea he not only wills them to tell that all things are ready, and to invite, but to <hi>Compel them</hi> (as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.23.) <hi>to come in:</hi> to ſtirr them up and preſs them to it: to threaten them if they come not, and to accept no refuſal or na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-ſay: the evidences of his willingneſs are many, which I will not now inſiſt upon: as that he hath made the feaſt, and ſuch a feaſt, and prepared ſo for it, and given himſelf to bring it about, and keeps up the offer and Proclamation of the Marriage, even after it is ſlighted: all theſe and many moe tell plainly that the Father and Son are moſt heartily willing: therefore they expoſtulat when this Marriage is refuſed, <hi>O! Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Jeruſalem how often would I have gathered you, but you would not:</hi> Matth. 23. <hi>O! Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, if thou even thou, hadſt known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace; Luk</hi> 19.

            <p>The Sixth <hi>Obſervation</hi> was, That the great work of the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>niſters of the Goſpel i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Souls to a cloſe: the Servants are ſent out for this very end, to conclude the bargain: Though he be Lord of all, yet he would not imploy in this work, Angels, neither would he ſpeak immediatly by his own voice from Heaven: for by rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n of his greatneſs we could not have endured that way of wooing: but ſayeth on the matter to men, ſubject to the like paſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities go tell that the King ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heir feet, for a Teſtimony againſt them that will not come.</p>
            <p>The Seventh <hi>Obſervation</hi> was that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is the duty of all to whom the good news of this marriage come to come to it, and when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them that come not, and our own great neceſſitie urgently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it?</p>
            <p>The Eighth and laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> was, that all they that come may expect a very good and heartſome
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:179825:38"/> welcome, none need to fear, that they ſhal not be made welcome, ſeeing they are come not uncalled, they ſhall not ſit unſerved: The Lord will not look down on ſuch as come: nay he is waiting on to welcome them, and to meet them, as it were Mid-way: as we ſee in the Parable of the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. His father ſtayes not till his ſon come to him, but ſeeing him afar-off coming, he runs with ſpeed to meet him, and then moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onatly embraced him and falls on his neck and kiſſes him; and if the poor child ſhould ſay, <hi>I am not worthy to be called a Son.</hi> He anſwers that, not ſuffering him to ſpeak out all that he had reſolved to ſay; Even when the debaucht runagate had ſpent all by riotous living and would fain have told out the ſad and ſhameful ſtory of his groſſe miſcarriages and great unworthineſs he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts him and ſays, in a manner, Son hold thy peace as to that, I know well it is grievous to thee, go quickly and put on the robe, the Ring and the ſhoes that are provided for thee.</p>
            <p>I come now in the <hi>Third</hi> place to make application of all; and is it poſſible to ſpeak or hear of this Subject, as becomes? who is ſufficient for theſe things; to ſpeak ſuitably in the name of the Lord, and to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you this contract of marriage with ſuch a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom? Beloved hearers, are ye in a ſuitable Poſture to tryſt with him? Do ye think that ye are for this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? is it your ſerious purpoſe to cloſe the bargain with him? If ſo, Pray the Lord to give us to ſpeak and you to hear the word in ſuch manner as it may be a marriage-day indeed: there are very good news here, and bleſſed eternally be God, that ever we heard them, or had them to ſpeak of, and that ye have them yet to hear; they ſhould make your very ſouls, in a manner, flighter within you, and make you to rouze up your
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:179825:38"/> ſelves, to welcome them with gladneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>Firſt,</hi> we would exhort you all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this report; there are alace! but few who doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed believe, that the Eternal God hath this deſign of a marriage betwixt him and ſinners? Therefore let not your hearts be ſtraitned, only believe that this is the good word of God, that theſe are the faithful &amp; true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of him that cannot lie, and that he is waiting on to ratifie them to all who give them Credit: It's ſomewhat hard to deliver or receive a word of threatning in faith, but in ſome reſpect, more hard to believe a word of Promiſe and of conſolation; It is Proportionably hard to look upon this as Gods own offering of a marriage with his Son, as if he himſelf were by <hi>vive voice</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of Heaven, and to believe that this offer is really his: and therefore as I deſire (as his Servant) to ſpeak to you, ſo I would, again and again, Obteſt you to be rouzed up, and to rouze up your ſelves to believe it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Rouze, ſtretch and enlarge your underſtandings, and your hearts and affections, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, conceiving and embracing this rich bargain of Grace: O! conſider ſeriouſly, from whom it is, For what end it is, how it is brought about, and doth come to you: the height and Depth, the Length and breadth whereof is inconceivable; be Holily amazed and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the offer of this marriage comes to you, and that he is content to marry you. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In a word, would you know what we have to do with you, or what is our commiſſion to you this day? This is even it, to tell you that the King hath made a marriage for his Son, and hath prepared and made all things ready for reuniting you to himſelf; yea this ſame King that hath made this wedding ready, and hath carved out this way of throughing his deſigne, by ſpeaking to you in his

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:179825:39"/> how ye ſhould come. 5. To the Peremptorineſs of the call, and to the necesſitie of coming, And 6. (If it be Poſſible to win at it) a word to ſome motives, whereby ye may be Preſſed to come, and not to neglect the opportunity of ſuch a Precious Seaſon of Grace.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt;</hi> it is not one or two or ſome few that are called, not the great only, nor the Smal only, not the holy only, nor the Profane only, but ye are all bidden, the call comes to all and every one of you in Particular, Poor and rich, high and low, holy and prophane; <hi>Ho</hi> (Proclaimeth the Lord, as it were, with an <hi>Oyas Iſa.</hi> 55.1.) <hi>Every one that thirſts, come, and he that hath no money, Let him come: whoſoever will let him come and take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely, Rev.</hi> 22.17. Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus is not ſtraitned in his call; and we may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſay in ſome meaſure, that we are not ſtraitened in our bowels; in his name we invite all of you, and make offer of Jeſus Chriſt to be your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; that ye may have <hi>a room among them that stand by, and be with him for ever:</hi> I ſay we make this offer to all of you, to you that are <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> to you that are <hi>Graceleſs,</hi> to you that are <hi>Ignorant,</hi> to you that are <hi>Hypocrits,</hi> to you that are <hi>Lazie</hi> and <hi>Luk-warm,</hi> to the Civil and to the Prophane; We pray, We beſeech, We obteſt you all to come to the wedding; <hi>Call</hi> (ſayeth the Lord) <hi>the blind, the maimed, the halt,</hi> &amp;c. Bid them all come, Yea <hi>compel them to come in:</hi> Grace can do moe &amp; greater wonders then to call ſuch, it cannot only make the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:179825:40"/> offer of the Marriage to them; but it can make up the Match effectually betwixt Chriſt and them: We will not, we dare not ſay, that all of you will get Chriſt for a Husband, but we do moſt really offer him to you all, and it ſhall be your own fault if ye want him and go without him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before we proceed any further, we do Solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Proteſt, and before God &amp; his Son Jeſus Chriſt, take inſtruments this day, that this offer is made to you; and that it is told to you in his name, that the Lord Jeſus is willing to match with you, even the profaneſt and moſt graceleſs of you, if ye be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to match with him; and he earneſtly invites you to come to the wedding: if you can touch at any thing on his ſide, that is not ready, or at any thing on your ſide, but it may through grace be made ready if ye will come, you may: but its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: for <hi>the Covenant is well o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dered and ſure,</hi> and that <hi>in all things,</hi> and theſe words are not the words of men, but the Words of <hi>the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſs,</hi> which ye muſt count and reckon for, when we are dead and gone: <hi>He hath killed his Oxen and Fatlings, and prepared his dinner and bid his gueſts: all things are ready,</hi> in the due order and manner, whether on your ſide or on his, if ye be willing to ſtep to and make the bargain, he hath drawn up the contract, and ſent us out with it to you, to crave your ſubſcription, and if ye be ready for that, he craves no more of you: Now, I put you all to it, whether will ye ſubſcribe it or not? and I would not put one of you without the reach
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:179825:40"/> of this invitation; however we be, Alace! much carnal in ſpeaking his mind, yet we deſire not to obſcure nor limit our Lords grace, he calls all of you to the wedding, he hath ſent us out as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (though of all the moſt unworthy) to cloſe and conclude the contract of Marriage with you this day, if you be willing. Come then, O come and ſubſcribe, and it ſhall be in very deed a bargain, if ye can through Grace ſay from your hearts, <hi>We will take him,</hi> then I ſay to you, <hi>take him and have him with the Fathers blesſing;</hi> our commiſſion is not only to offer him, and to invite you to take him, but to cloſe a bargain betwixt him and you who are content to take him: we would (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2) <hi>Eſpouſe you to one huſband, that we m ght preſent you a chaſt Virgin to Chriſt,</hi> and have you hand-faſted to him, as the word is: and this is very well becoming one of the dayes of the Son of man, and one of ſuch ſeaſons of his grace, to make this offer to great and ſmall, rich and Poor, learned and unlearned, Gracious and Graceleſs, Hypocrites and prophane; there is here no excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons with him; the bleſſed God is content to match with the moſt graceleſs and Godleſs of you, as well as with thoſe who are gracious and Godly; <hi>There is joy in heaven at the converſion of a ſinner,</hi> and the price was payed for the Elect, that are yet Graceleſs, as well as for theſe of them who are now gracious; for all were once in the ſame condition; Therefore look not with narrow and ſtraitned hearts on the Rich and liberal allowance of our Bleſſed Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:179825:41"/>
            <p>But Secondly, what is it that we call you to, when we bid you come to the Marriage; It's not to the Communion only, It's not to any of Chriſts benefits only, it's not to ſay at firſt hand confidently that all is yours, or to have a ſure knowledge (as ye call it) and perſwaſion at the very firſt that it is ſo; though I heartily wiſh that ye may find this Perſwaſion on ſolid and good grounds; but it is firſt and mainly to marry the Bridegroom, and then to come to the Feaſt: We call you to believe, and we declare in his Name, that if ye will betake your ſelves to him in good earneſt, ye ſhall be ſaved: If ye will as it were, put your hand to the Pen, and Subſcribe your ſelves heartily content to take him, ye ſhall moſt certainly have him and all his benefits: ye that are Prophane take him, but not to live ſtill in your Profanity, but to ſtudy Holineſs in all manner of converſation in his ſtrength; Ye that are ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous take him, but not to live ſtill in the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of your ſelf-righteouſneſs, but to renounce it, and to take him for your righteouſneſs; ye that are blind take him, but not to live ſtill in your blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but to grow in grace and in the knowledge of him: whatever ye be, and whatever ill aileth you, take him, but not to continue in the ill, but to get it amended: This ſure is no leſs then to call you to the communion, yea it is more, whether therefore ye come to the Communion or not, we call and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you all to come to Chriſt, and to marry Him; which if ye do, we dare Promiſe you in his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun Communion with him here, &amp; full communion with him in Heaven hereafter.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:179825:41"/>
            <p>Thirdly what are the termes on which ye are called and may warrantably come to this marriage? I need not ſtand on the terms on his ſide, nor to tell you what he promiſeth, It's this in a word, <hi>I will be for thee:</hi> He is content to make over all that is his to you; Pardon of Sin, Juſtification, Sanctification, his Spirit to quicken you, even his whole Purchaſe to enrich you: in Sum (as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31.) <hi>He is made of God unto you Wiſdome, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> He hath made all things yours (as it is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21.) <hi>And in him ye are compleat,</hi> (as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10.) Ye need never go out of him, to ſeek for any thing truly good that ye ſtand in need of. And on the other hand, what ſeeks be of you but <hi>to be for him and not for another:</hi> (as it is <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.) He ſeeks no hard condition: In Sum it may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that word 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.31. <hi>That he that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth may glory in the Lord:</hi> not to glory or boaſt in any thing or in our ſelves, but of him, and in him. But for clearneſs cauſe I ſhall draw the termes on your ſide to theſe <hi>there.</hi> 1 You muſt deny your ſelf, Your luſts, and Idols and your own righteouſneſs: <hi>Where is boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then?</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.) <hi>It is excluded; by what law, of works? nay, but the law of Faith:</hi> Ye then that would Marry Chriſt and ſhare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the feaſt; ye muſt have a ſight of that which ye want; and of your own inability to make it up: and that ye are undone in your ſelves without him, <hi>to him that worketh not, but Believeth on him that Juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs:</hi> That is, to him that expects nothing by his works, but betakes himſelf to Chriſt and his righteouſneſs for his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God: and that is no unreaſonable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly as ye would not glory in your ſelves, ſo
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:179825:42"/> ye would glory in him: what ever ye deny in your ſelves ye would put him in the room of it: If ye dare not lippen or truſt your ſouls to your own right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, lippen or truſt them to his: He ſayes I am content to pay your debt, and ſince ye canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pay your own debt your ſelves, ſay humbly to him, bleſſed Lord Jeſus pay our debt for us; <hi>He is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth Rom.</hi> 10.3. When he offers himſelf, take him thus, and let Faith ſay, ſobeit Lord, I accept of the bargain, Q! hold to it and quit it not. Thirdly, It is required that ye ſhall be his and have no Power over your ſelves: and this takes in Sanctification, dying to ſin and living to Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, adorning the Goſpel, living anſwerably to the ſeverall relations ye ſtand in: for though Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and holineſs be not the cauſe, for which he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet it is a condition of the contract; and it well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Bride to be dutifull: <hi>Thou shalt be for me, and I will be for thee,</hi> If he will graciouſly pleaſe to be for us, it's all the reaſon in the World that we ſhould be for him: Now we know ſomewhat of the terms, which may all come in under theſe <hi>three,</hi> there are many conditions on his ſide and but few on ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> ye would conſider the Peremptorineſs of this call, to accept of and to Marrie our Lord Jeſus Chriſt on theſe terms, it's not an ordinary complement, but purpoſed by the King the Father, and by the Kings Son the Bridgroom: He ſends out his Servants, who are come to call you Peremptorily: and there are <hi>three Peremptories,</hi> that this offer and call hath with it: all which three we carry in our commiſſion, and crave of you to Subſcribe to them. The 1. Whereof is; that ye take no other husband but this Bridegroom, there is no latitude left to you in this; ye muſt by no means engage
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:179825:42"/> with any other; It's only for Jeſus Chriſt that we woo, and we ſeek of you that ye would give him your ſouls, your hearts, and affections, that ye may be devoted to him and to no other; and therefore we intimat to you that are Married and Joyned to Idols, that ye muſt be divorced from thoſe and betake you to him alone The <hi>Second</hi> Is, the Peremptorineſs of the terms we ſpeak of; we cannot and ye muſt not alter one jote or title, Ye muſt deny your ſelves, ye muſt be content to be divorc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from your luſts and Idols, ye muſt renounce your own righteouſneſs, and give up with the law your firſt husband, conſidered as a Covenant of works, and run out from the curſes thereof to him, which ye will never do; till ye ſee your own righteouſneſs to be as filthy rags, and reject it, as Part of your enditement, that ever ye truſted to it. Ye muſt forget your fathers houſe. 2. As you muſt deny your ſelves, ſo you muſt cloſe with Chriſt, and embrace him for your husband and Lord: do not think that ye will or can dwel beſide him, that ye can ſit and hear him: if ye Marrie him not. 3. Ye muſt be devoted to him in your converſation, he muſt needs be your King as well as your Prieſt; Ye muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Father and Mother and all your kindred and betake you to him, and ye muſt take up and keep houſe with him, you muſt dwel with him, and ſtudy to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Marriage tye and obligation put upon you, we dare diſpenſe with none of the <hi>Three.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> Peremptory is this, as ye muſt engage with no other, and as ye muſt not alter the terms, ſo ye muſt not delay to come and cloſe the bargain, ye muſt not put off till to morrow, nay not an hour; <hi>All things are ready,</hi> Juſt now, <hi>Now is the accepted time;</hi> Here ſtands the bleſted Bridgroom, here are the conditions and terms on which he will marry you, and we as the Bridegrooms
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:179825:43"/> friends ſtand ready to eſpouſe you to him: We dare not be anſwerable to our Maſter, nor can we be anſwerable to our truſt and commiſſion, if we ſhuffle by, or thruſt out any of you, if ye do not thruſt out your ſelves, nor may we admite of an excuſe from any of you: and therefore let me again ſay to you, that here is not only a marriage, and of all marriages the moſt excellent; but let me beſeech and obteſt you to come to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; either come or give a reaſon why ye will not, or cannot: as you can aſſigne no relevant reaſon for your not coming, we dare not accept of any Irrelevant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor admit of any anſwer but this, that ye will take him: we dare admit of no excuſe: ye muſt not ſhift nor delay: ye would think that thoſe who were bidden <hi>Luke</hi> 14. might have come, when they had ſeen their Farme and proved their Oxen: but that would not be with them: So I ſay it will not be with you, to ſhift this offer: He is here waiting on to ſee who will conſent and ſay <hi>even ſo I take him:</hi> Say it, O ſay it ſeriouſly and abide by it.</p>
            <p>Q! Are there any here now looking up to him? Are there any here that would fain have it a cloſed bargain? Are there any here that believe theſe things as the truths of God? Then we pray you let them ſink down into your hearts, and come. And to preſs this a little further, let me <hi>ask,</hi> what can hinder the making of this bargain? is it the want of notice or timeous intimation of it? That cannot he, ye are clearly convinced of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Is it becauſe ye will or can be happy without him? Wo to that happineſs: is it any difficulty ſtanding in the way? That ſhall be removed, yea as to him it is removed already, and ſhall be as to you on your cloſing with him: Poſe and put your own hearts to it then, Is there any of you that dare or can find in your hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:179825:43"/> refuſe? the Lord is waiting on; his faithfulneſs is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to make out what he offereth; He ſtretcheth out his hand, and ſayeth, <hi>Even ſo I take you,</hi> if ye will take me; are ye content to ſtretch forth your hand and to ſay, <hi>Even ſo I take thee bleſſed Lord Jeſus:</hi> or if this be not win at to Satisfaction, are there any rouzing and ſtretching themſelves to eſſay how it will go with them? what are ye doing? Is it a bargain or not? ye muſt ſay, yea or nay, and that even now; We ſuppoſe ye will not ſay down right, nay: though more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably many will delay: but this muſt not be, the Table may be drawn, other gueſts may be called in and ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: we cannot allow you an hours time to adviſe, eſpecially from indifferency, yea if ye begin to take adviſement for ſhifting a preſent cloſure, Chriſts call and invitation, and your conſenting will readily cool upon your hand: <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes <hi>that he conſulted not with flesh and blood:</hi> So muſt not ye conſult with fleſh and blood in this matter, ye muſt caſt away the beggars cloak, be content to deny your ſelf, quite your luſts, and cloſe with him preſently, or ye may never have the like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, There is a neceſſity impoſed on you from the command to come, from the curſe and prejudice that abides you, and will certainly overtake you if you come not: ye will be eternalie miſerable without him, there is no happineſs but in him: The King is on his Throne, the Table is ſet and covered, the day is fixed, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants invite in his name: come therefore, come without further lingering, dallying, ſhifting or delay: alace! there are too many dayes put by already, ye muſt put by no moe.</p>
            <p>Now let me ſpeak a word further to this purpoſe, what can marr the matter, what can obſtruct its being a bargain? certainly it muſt be one of <hi>three:</hi> Either
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:179825:44"/> firſt: becauſe ye are not content with the Bridegroom, Or Secondly becauſe ye are not content with the terms. Or Thirdly becauſe ye are not content with your ſelves or with ſome thing in your ſelves: As for the <hi>Firſt:</hi> I ſuppoſe ye can ſay nothing againſt the Bridegroom: is there any other like to him or that can compare with him; I appeal even to you Atheiſts, and Profane Wretches, that live and ly in your Luſts, Is there a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved like this Beloved? hath He a match in Heaven or Earth? Is He not the Kings Son? and if ye ask who that is, ye may hear and know from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. <hi>The King of Glory, the Lord of Hoſts, ſtrong and mighty in Battel,</hi> and from <hi>Heb</hi> 1.3. <hi>The brightneſs of the Fathers Glory, the expreſs Image of his Perſon, upholding all things by the word of his Power:</hi> There is none like him, but the Father, and the Holy Spirit, and as God he is one with them, ye have both the Queſtion and anſwer, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?</hi> What is yonder Chriſt of whom we hear ſo much?

                  </gap>, the chiefeſt, or Standard bearer among ten thouſands, Fairer then the Sons of men;</hi> and if ye would know him more Particularly, <hi>His head is as the moſt fine gold,</hi> He is God: <hi>His locks (or his hair) are bushie and black as a Raven:</hi> there is not the leaſt unſeemlineſs, even in thoſe things that would, to our thinking, ſeem leſs neceſſary, as his hair; <hi>Yea his very Garments ſmel of Myrrhe, Aloes, and Caſsia,</hi> (as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.) <hi>His eyes are as the eyes of Doves by the Rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly ſet,</hi> O! ſo lovely as his Properties are, <hi>his Cheeks as beds of Spices, as ſweet flowers: His lips like Lilies dropping ſweet ſmelling Myrrhe: his hands, as Gold rings ſet with Berill: His belly</hi> (or bowels of love and

So excellent and ſtately: <hi>His mouth is moſt ſweet,</hi> or (as the word is) ſweetneſs, in the abſtract: never ſoul kiſſed his mouth, but there was a bond there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laid on it, that it could never again part with him: in a word, <hi>He is altogether lovely,</hi> or (as the word is) <hi>all deſires:</hi> there is nothing that Souls can deſire but it is in him: and there is nothing in him, but what has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireableneſs in it: <hi>This is my beloved and this is my Friend</hi> (ſays the Bride) <hi>O! ye Daughters of Jeruſalem:</hi> this is He, he is ſure no common or ordinary Beloved: ſee if among all the beloveds in Heaven or earth there be any like Him: O! Ye deſpiſers and ſlighters of the Son of God, put your ſelves to it, Is there any like him to be found? has he not the preference of and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence above all beloveds? <hi>He is the only begotten of the Father full of Grace and truth; He is the mighty God, the wonderfull Counſeller, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> It would well become us all to be wondering at him, and to be drawing near to him, to behold Him in his beauty; <hi>To go forth and Behold King</hi> Solomon <hi>with the Crown wherewith his Mother Crowned him in the day of his eſpouſals:</hi> O! take a ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed view of him in his Perſonall excellencies and in the excellent qualifications of this Mediatory Office, and it cannot be that on this ground ye will caſt at the Match, Will any of you dare to ſay it or to abide by it, that ye will not Marry Chriſt, becauſe ye think nothing of him, or becauſe he is not worthy to be thought of? We ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe none will do ſo.</p>
            <p>If it be the <hi>Second, viz. The terms,</hi> That ye are not content with; ye would have Chriſt, Grace, and Glory,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:179825:45"/> and every good thing; but here it ſticketh, you look at it as an hard matter to be denyed to your ſelf and to be wholly Gods, to renounce your own righteouſneſs, and your luſts, &amp; your Idols, to be abſolutely devoted to him and wholly dependent on him in your walk, As <hi>the evil &amp; the ſlothfull Servant</hi> called him <hi>a hard Maſter;</hi> So do many think of him, though they will not down right ſay ſo much in expreſs words: But I would ask you, is there any unreaſonable thing here? Or ſhall all thoſe termes be ſought after, in ſome reſpect, in the Marriage of a poor creature like your ſelves? And will ye deny them to Chriſt? 1. If you get his righteouſneſs; ſhould ye not deny your own? If ye come under the Covenant of Grace with him, is there any prejudice to lay by the Covenant of works? If ye get him for your ſecond Husband, and infinitly beſt, is it any prejudice to quit your firſt husband <hi>the Law?</hi> And in that reſpect is it reaſonable to caſt at the bargain, becauſe it is free? <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> Is it not reaſonable that ye ſhould give him the room of all things? If He be able to fill the room of all, let him have his room, as being well worthy of it; It is your advantage to quit your luſts and ſinfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, your covetouſneſs, Pride, vanity, ſelf conceit, &amp;c. To exchange all for him; and if ye be not content of this condition, ye ſay he is not worth the having. 3. Is it not reaſonable that ye ſhould be devoted to him in your Converſation? That ye ſhould no longer Play the harlot, but be as a chaſt Virgin to him? Is it any advantage to you to follow your Idols, that wil go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt you and happineſs? If Heaven be an advantage, it is your advantage to quit them and be for Chriſt; Or is it any Prejudice to be Holy? Or will ye quit Chriſt, becauſe ye muſt be Holy?

Our Lord ſtands not on that, though you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not write well, do as ye can: It's ſtrange to ſee, how ſomes Subſcription is almoſt like a ſcratching with <hi>Crow</hi>-toes, yet it's a valid Subſcription; ſome again will write down their mark in place of their name, and that alſo where it is well known, is admitted as valid; if you cannot (as it were) write your name in fair and legible Letters, ſet down ſome Mark, if it were but two ſcores or lines in any form or figure, If ye cannot act Faith ſo diſtinctly, come on as you may; if ye cannot to your ſatisfaction ſay, <hi>Yea,</hi> with the heart, ſay it with the mouth, ſtriving and longing to have thy heart brought up; force thy ſelf (If I may ſpeak ſo) to believing; <hi>If thou shalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and shalt believe with thy heart, that God raiſed Him from the dead, thou shalt be ſaved, Rom.</hi> 10.9. Endeavour to make thy Mouth engage thine heart; bind thy ſelf faſt to Chriſt, even in a manner whether thou wilt or not: act Faith with the underſtanding, labouring honeſtly to bring up thy Will and affections and though ye win not now to a Faith that is diſtinct, it ſhall come in a due time: eſſay to ſet open the door, and it ſhall go with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But my heart ſays, all theſe are but fair words? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Away with that blaſphemy, They are the truths of God: eſſay then, O! eſſay Seriouſly this way of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and ye ſhall find power meeting you, The Pen is, as it were, lying by you, and albeit ye cannot write well and be diſtinct, take the Pen, and Chriſt ſhall (as it were) lead your hand and guide it, to write ſo, as it ſhall Paſs in Heaven for a Subſcribed conſent: ſet your ſelves to give him a welcome, and he ſhall account it to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:179825:47"/> be a welcome. Say now, what more ye have to ſay; lay out your ſcruples; this word, <hi>all things are ready,</hi> will anſwer them all: the garment is ready to be put on, yea Jeſus Chriſt is your Wedding Garment, take and put him on: He is the cure for all your diſeaſes, apply him for the cure of them all; ye cannot certainly be clothed, before you put on the garment: neither can ye be Healed, before ye apply the cure: ye cannot by any means be rich, till ye marry him. But beſide all theſe, there are ſeveral other needleſly diſquieting ſcruples, there are many other ſhifts (and alace! that there ſhould be ſuch triffling, if I may call it ſo, ſuch whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, and ſtanding on Ceremonies (to ſpeak ſo) with our Lord,) among which this is one, I wot not If I be in the Covenant and Contract of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I know not if I be one of Gods elect: <hi>Anſ.</hi> What is this? ye know not well what ye ſay: have ye any thing to do with that ſecret by a leap and at Firſt hand? are ye not called to Marry Chriſt? Is not that his revealed will to you? I proteſt in his name, this is the thing that ye are called to: and will ye make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, where he has made none? Or will ye ſhift obedience to a clear command, upon a ſuppoſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which you cannot know but by the effects? Will ye reaſon ſo in the matter of your eating and drinking? upon a ſuppoſition that God hath decreed, that ye ſhall die to Morrow or within a few dayes, will ye this day not take your dinner, nor make uſe of any refreſhment, till that ſuppoſed day come? Or becauſe ye know not, if God hath appointed you to live ſo and ſo long? Will ye forbear therefore your callings? Or will any of you, in ſeeking after a match in the World, reaſon ſo? Will ye not ſeek after nor Marry ſuch a Woman, till ye be clear that God hath decreed her to be your Wife? When
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:179825:48"/> or whom would ye Marry at this rate of reaſoning? But 2. Becauſe there is a ſort of facultie and facilitie here to diſpute againſt God, I anſwer by way of queſtion, were there ever any that had that doubt cleared to them before they came to Chriſt? whoever would have come to him, if they had ſtayed till that had been taken out of the way? Or hath the Lord told that to any before they came? Hath he ſaid to them, believe for ye are Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but his method is thus, believe, and ye ſhall know in due time that ye are Elected. 3 Is there any that can ſay, that the offer or the refuſall of the match de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on this? If any of you will ſay, becauſe I was not elected, he refuſed me: He will anſwer, <hi>How often would I have gathered you?</hi> And there will need no more ground for ſentencing Profeſſors of the Goſpel to deſtruction, then this, Man, woman, thou hadſt the offer of the Goſpel and refuſedſt it, therefore go to thy place: he will not Judge you according to the decree of reprobation, but according to his call and your diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it: And further ye may take Chriſts <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Objection,</hi> from <hi>John</hi> 6.39. Where there are two <hi>wills,</hi> or rather two <hi>things willed,</hi> of equal extent betwixt the Father and Chriſt in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, under which all the elect come: The <hi>Firſt</hi> is <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath ſent me, that of all that he hath given me, I should loſe nothing;</hi> But, as if he had ſaid, this is not it that ye have to do with at firſt hand: Therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 40. He ſayes. <hi>And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son and Believeth on Him may have everlaſting life:</hi> Not that all the elect ſhould know that they are elected, before they Believe; but that he that Believes in Him, may know that he is Elected: He gives the ſame promiſe to them that Believe, that is given to them
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:179825:48"/> that are Elected: and they are diſtinguiſhed, becauſe He would have them to come under diſtinct conſiderations.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, Is there not need, great need to come? and have ye not good warrand to come? Lay by, therefore, ſeeking ſatisfaction to ſenſe and carnal reaſon: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THere are two great works that the Miniſters of the Goſpel have to do; one is to engage People to Chriſt, and to perſwade them to receive him and cloſe with him; The other is to induce them to walk worthy of him: <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk ye in Him. Paul</hi> through the hand of the Lord with him, had engaged the <hi>Philippians</hi> to cloſe with Chriſt, and as it were to conclude the Contract betwixt him and them: and now being aged and in Priſon, and not knowing certainly if ever he ſhall ſee them again, He commends this to them in a ſpeciall manner, whether he ſee them or be abſent from them; that <hi>only they would let their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:179825:49"/> be, as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> As if he had ſaid, ye are priviledged with the Goſpel, and have embraced it, and are eminent in the Profeſſion thereof; let me therefore beg this of you; that your Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be anſwerable to it. The adverb <hi>only,</hi> intimats to them, that this was ſo neceſſary and of ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that in a manner it was their <hi>one thing</hi> they had to do, In compariſon of which, in a manner, they had no other thing elſe to do, whether he were Preſent or abſent; This in ſome reſpect, is all that he requires of them: And the Argument whereby he preſſeth it is, <hi>that whether he come to them or not, he may hear of their affairs;</hi> And that he deſires and expects, whether he be at Liberty, or in Priſon and bonds; that they will thus eſpecially teſtifie their reſpect to him; which would be more refreſhing and acceptable to him, then their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to him in his affliction, beyond all the reſt of the Churches, was, and for which he commends them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. And in the cloſe of the <hi>verſe</hi> he inſtanceth <hi>Two</hi> Particulars, wherein he would have their Converſation ſuiting the Goſpel; or <hi>Two</hi> qualifications of a Goſpel-Converſation and walk: <hi>one</hi> is, <hi>Unity that they ſtand faſt in one Spirit, Another is, Purity</hi> in the Faith; <hi>that with one mind they ſtrive together for the Faith of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Qualification is, joint and united ſtayedneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs, that they be not fleeting and wavering to and fro, eaſily disjointed and divided one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as many light Profeſſors are: And the <hi>Second</hi> is, that they be ſtudious in and ſtriving for the Purity of the Doctrine of Faith, and ſerious in the Practice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith; Deſireable and excellent Qualifications of a Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> Purity, Solidity, and ſeriouſneſs in Religion.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:179825:50"/>
            <p>We ſhall at this time ſpeak of the exhortation, <hi>Only let your Converſation be, as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> Where, by <hi>Converſation,</hi> we underſtand the whole of a mans carriage and walk towards and before God and men; and by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the whole Doctrine thereof, as it reſpects Faith and manners or Practice, but here more eſpecially, as it reſpects Faith in Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſt, both as it is oppoſed to <hi>Heatheniſme,</hi> and as it's oppoſed to the Law or Covenant of Works: To walk then <hi>as becometh the Goſpel,</hi> is to walk anſwerably and ſuitably to it, and in the whole of their carriage and Depo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The point of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to which we would ſpeak from theſe words, and which lyeth obviouſly in them is; That, they who are Priviledged with the Goſpel, ought ſeriouſly to endeavour, and to make it their great buſineſs, to have their Converſation ſuitable to, and becoming the ſame. This is ſome way the <hi>one thing</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all the hearers of the Goſpel, of all that are Baptized in the name of Chriſt: We need not ſtay on the Proof and reaſons of it, and the leſſe, that none will dare down-right to denie it, and that the reaſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:179825:50"/>
            <p>As for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> I think I may ſay, that if ye had the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Preaching to you who have been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants yeſter-day, this would be the great dutie which he would enforce upon you: <hi>Only let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be, as it becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi> Ye will readilie ſay, what is that? I confeſs it's hard to tell, it's ſo verie Marrowie and comprehenſive, but it will be as hard to practiſe it, and a great deal harder: O that we were all Breathing and Preſſing ſeriouſlie and hard after it! However, we ſhall in the firſt Place, and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſire you to conſider theſe few Scriptures that hold it out, as namelie, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Philip.</hi> 3 20.</p>
            <p>More Particularlie, from other Scriptures ye may take it up in theſe: or if we read and conſider the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel aright, we will find theſe <hi>Five</hi> things in it, which require a walk ſuitable, or a walk with reſpect to them: and ſuch a walk becomes the Goſpel. 1. In the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, Our bleſſed Lord Jeſus is (as it were) the <hi>Text</hi> on whom the Goſpel is a notable Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, and what he did and how he ſuffered, is propoſed as a fair Copie for us to write after in all things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ſet forth to us as a pattern for our Imitation. 2. That from whence the Goſpel comes, and which gives it it's riſe, even the Love of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holie Ghoſt, in whoſe bleſſed breaſt it bred; and <hi>To walk as it becomes the Goſpel,</hi> is to walk ſuitablie to that love. 3. To walk as becomes the Goſpel, is to walk ſuitablie to the great offers of it, and to the Promiſes contained in it, <hi>The exceeding great and Precious Promiſes, whereby we are made Partakers of the Divine nature:</hi> To walk ſuitablie to all the excellent things, the ſublimelie Spirituall and divine things Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. 4. It is to walk ſuitablie to the Commands and directions
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:179825:51"/> of the Goſpel, in reference to all duties: <hi>having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.) <hi>Theſe Promiſes let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> 5. It is to walk anſwerablie to the obligations which the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel lays on us, and to the conſolations that flow from it to us: If then we would walk as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt, we muſt have a due reſpect unto all theſe.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be enquired what is it to have a reſpect to theſe in our walk? We anſwer, it ſuppoſeth and includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe things. 1. A likeneſs and conformitie, that what is called for in the matter of dutie, or offered in the Promiſe, we ſtudie to be like it, <hi>We all</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 18.) <hi>Beholding, as in a Glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> 2. Our ſuffering none of theſe things to ly by us unimproved, &amp; our endevouring to make the right uſe of them: to ſuffer none of the Promiſes relating to Juſtification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or any other Spiritual priviledge and benefit to be uſeleſs, but to be laying due weight on each of them: and more eſpeciallie to be making right uſe of Chriſt the Mediator, <hi>in whom all the Promiſes are yea and amen:</hi> (for certainlie they neither walk as it becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor are worthie of it, who make not uſe of him) to be making right uſe of the Ordinances, word and Sacraments, and of all appointed means of edification, Publick, Privat and ſecret, and to be making right uſe of the comforts of the Goſpel, whereof there is through Chriſt a verie large and liberal allowance on Chriſtians. 3. It includes our delighting our ſelves in the Goſpel, our endeavouring to be cheerfull, to be cheered and made glad by the good things in it: A heartleſs drooping &amp; diſcouraged life and walk is verie unbecoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:179825:51"/>
            <p>We may in a word, briefly ſum up a Chriſtians Converſation as becometh the Goſpel, in theſe <hi>Three;</hi> 1. That he ſhine in his Converſation, ſo as he may adorne the Goſpel, 2. That he improve, by the exerciſe of Faith, the Promiſes of it. 3. That he endeavour to live on the comforts of it, and to live in the hope and expectation of the comfort &amp; refreſhing, from the Preſence of the Lord, and the fulneſs of joyes therein, that are coming: ſome-what of all theſe <hi>Three</hi> is couched in thoſe Words, <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Then the Churches had rest, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Holy Ghoſt, were multiplied:</hi> They walked in the fear of God in reſpect of their Practice: and in reſpect of their Faith, they walked <hi>in the comfort of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and they were <hi>Edified,</hi> grew and increaſed, not only in reſpect of their number, but as to their Spiritual ſtate and ſtature; And thus, <hi>the Peace of God which paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th underſtanding, guarded their minds and hearts through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or ye may look on the Goſpel as calling for theſe <hi>Two</hi> things, in our external and viſible converſation; 1. That none get any occaſion by our walk to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Goſpel: that none may have it, on any juſt ground given by us, to ſay, take up ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Goſpel; O! What prejudice to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, is done this way, by the untender walk of many of it's Profeſſors. 2. It is to walk ſo, as our Carriage may be a Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Goſpel, &amp; an Ornament to the Profeſſion of it, that, not only, reproachers may be aſhamed,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:179825:52"/> who falſly accuſe our good Converſation; but by beholding of it, they may be made to glorifie God: that we may ſhine as lights by our blameleſs walk; ſo holding forth the word of Life (being practicall Preachers) by our convincing and edifieing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, in our ſeverall Capacities, Callings, Stations and Relations, that they who are not won by the word, may be won to the love of Chriſt, and of Holineſs by our examplary converſation, and by the humble, tender and conſcientious diſcharge of the duties of thoſe callings and relations; the Husband being kind and the wife Tractable, Child and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant obedient, &amp;c. Excellent directions to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are given by the Apoſtles, and particularly by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in their <hi>Epiſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More Particularly (which yet will be but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what generall) We may conſider the Goſpel. 1. As it holds forth and calls for Holineſs, and ſo, for a Holy and Goſpel-becoming Converſation. And 2. We would take a view of the nature of this Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> The Goſpel calls for Holineſs in a ſixfold extent; a failing or defect in any of which, makes a Converſation in ſo far to be unbecoming the Goſpel. 1. It calls for Holineſs in reſpect of all ſorts of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>be ye Holy</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>in all manner of Converſation, as God is Holy:</hi> in Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Adverſity: in Religious, in Morall, and in Natural Actions; <hi>for it is written, be ye Holy for I am Holy.</hi> 2. It is extended univerſally to all Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and individuall duties and actions of all thoſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:179825:52"/> ſorts; it reacheth all manner of Converſation; The Divinely inſpired Scriptures inſtruct the man of God, how he may be made Perfect in every good work, as it is, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And a failing in thought, word or deed is unbecoming the Goſpel. 3. It is extended in reſpect of the ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole man, and Preſſeth that he be Sanctified throughout, So 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. The Apoſtle Prays, <hi>the God of peace Sanctifie you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit Soul and Body, be Preſerved blameleſs;</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. It puts to <hi>cleanſe from all filth of the Fleſh and Spirit:</hi> It requires that the <hi>Judgements</hi> be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſound, and that no error or untruth be admitted by it, that the <hi>Mind</hi> be ſober, and free from any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſtemper; that the <hi>affections</hi> be Sanctifiedly regular, and that they debord not: That the <hi>will</hi> be ſtraight and brought up to the ſtraight rule of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and that the <hi>Conſcience</hi> be keeped tender, that it be neither darkned nor impure; That the <hi>members of the Body</hi> be yeelded as inſtruments unto righteouſneſs. 4. It is extended to holineſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all capacities, Callings, Stations and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, of Husbands and Wives, of Maſters and Servants, of Parents and Children, as the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> Heartily and frequently doth in his <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> namely, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. and 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. and 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. Where he preſſes it upon Servants by this Argument, <hi>That the Doctrine of God may be adorned:</hi> and on wives by this, <hi>that the Doct ine of God may not be blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and on all thus, <hi>That the grace of God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Goſpel (for that very end.</hi> 5.

Having Him for our Pattern.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould here <hi>Object.</hi> And ſay: to look on the Goſpel thus, as carving out a Chriſtians duty and walk ſo very exactly, in this extent and at this pitch, makes it appear to be very ſtrict, and to differ litle or nothing from the Law; for what more doth that call for? So that this Doctrine ſeems to be legal. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> ſeems to Imply a great miſtake; for the difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel, is not ſo much, if at all, in this; that the Law requires more then the Goſpel; but that it requires what it calls for, on another Certification: The Law and the Goſpel agree in theſe <hi>Three.</hi> 1. The Goſpel requires Holineſs in as large an extent as the Law, ſo that whatever is a ſin againſt the Law, is alſo a ſin againſt the Goſpel; For Chriſt <hi>came not to aboli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h but to fulfill the Law.</hi> 2. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Holineſs at the ſame Pitch or in the ſame
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:179825:53"/> degree; for the Goſpel commands us to <hi>be holy as God is Holy, and to be perfect as our Heavenly Father is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi> It diſpenſeth with no ſin, nor with any degree of any ſin, nor with the leaſt <hi>Omisſion</hi> of any dutie, more then doth the Law. 3. The Authority and obligation, that lyes on and binds to Holineſs, is no leſs in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, then it is in the Law: yea, we may ſay, that the obligation is in ſome reſpect greater.</p>
            <p>But they deffer in theſe <hi>Three,</hi> 1. That the Goſpel taketh in the Penitent, though he hath not been perfect and exact, and gives him pardon through Chriſt: which the Law doth not. 2. The Goſpel calleth for dutie in the ſtrength of Chriſt, and furniſheth ſtrength for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but the Law now furniſheth no ſtrength, but only ſuppoſeth it; It only giveth out the word of Command, requiring of men that they walk in the ſtrength which they had once in <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that, though the Authority and Obligation be the ſame: yet the manner and Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not the ſame; if there be any breach or fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the law ſayes, <hi>Thou shalt certainly die:</hi> But the Goſpel (as I ſaid; admits of Repentance and fleeing to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who took on him the curſe of the Law.</hi> 3. The law accepts of no dutie, if it be not exactly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the degree: But the Goſpel accepts of duty, though imperfect, if there be ſincerity: It <hi>accepts</hi> on Chriſts account of <hi>a man, according to that which he hath, if there be a willing mind.</hi> So then, when ye are called to walk <hi>as becomes the Goſpel:</hi> ye would know that ye are not to diſpenſe with your ſelves, in the leaſt, in any duty that the law calleth for: though the Goſpel doth indeed more ſweetly call for it, Its <hi>Exactors and officers being peace and righteouſneſs:</hi> It's the ſame Holineſs in the <hi>matter, extent and degree,</hi> which the Goſpel calleth for, with that of the Law; though it much differeth, as to the <hi>Manner</hi> of calling for it.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:179825:54"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That we may know, what is called for in the Goſpel, as a walk or Converſation becoming the ſame: and ſo may yet further know the nature of Goſpel-holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (which was the <hi>Second</hi> thing we propoſed to ſpeak to) Ye would conſider the Goſpel, as it's diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the law, and as it holds our Grace: Where we would ſpeak, 1. Of ſome qualifications, that the Goſpel addeth, as to the Performance of the ſame duties, which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Law requires. 2. Of ſome particular duties which it doth more eſpecially call for, and which were not, (ſeverals of them, at leaſt) ſo proper to the law.</p>
            <p>As for the qualifications of dutie, which the Goſpel addeth, they are theſe. 1. A new end; for our end in duty now is, not to gain life by it, but ſimply to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, as we may ſee. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. I will not ſay, but this end was in the Covenant of works, but in the Goſpel this is not only the main end, but ſome way the only end, and the other quite excluded and thruſt out; and when we ſpeak of the <hi>glory of God,</hi> we take in the glory of Grace and the glory of the Redeemer, who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth Grace. 2. It adds a ſweet Motive, <hi>viz.</hi> love to Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>The love of Ch iſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.) <hi>Conſtraineth us:</hi> It is no more meer awe, that is the Motive, but love and love to God in Chriſt, who hath redeemed and bought us. 3. The Goſpel qualifies our obedience and walk, as to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking thereof: that it be not in our own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of Jeſus Chriſt: it teacheth us to go through the wilderneſs <hi>leaning on the Beloved,</hi> and leaving the burden of the work on him; truſting more to him, then to our own feet or ſtrength, as knowing that we cannot criple out the way, nor do any thing without him, as it is. <hi>John</hi> 15.5, 4. There is a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179825:54"/> Qualification, required in reſpect of the frame of our own heart, with reſpect to a twofold fear, one is a filial and reverentiall fear, that proceeds from Faith, in which we are <hi>to work out the work of our Salvation.</hi> The other is, that it be without the fear that is oppoſite to the former as the word is. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. The Goſpel calleth us in our walk, to have a fear without fear, a reverentiall fear, without ſlaviſh fear: it would have us neither to be altogether afraid becauſe of the Law, which hath terror, nor to be without filial fear, for that is preſumption, but to have faith and fear mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. 5. The Goſpel qualifies our walk in ſpiritual duties, in reſpect of our cheerfulneſs in going about them, which are to us (in ſo far as we have corruption in us) Heavy and grievous; but the Goſpel maketh them eaſy and light, as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. His yoke is eaſie and His burden light.</hi> Though it be a Yoke, yet it is portable and light, when Chriſt and the Believer are yoked together: nor are <hi>any of His Commands grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,</hi> as it is 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. 6. Though the Goſpel call for Holineſs, yet it makes the perſon to be denyed to it, It's a Goſpel-walk to be Holy, but it takes in that with it which we have <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>To forget thoſe things that are behind:</hi> to be denyed and dead to all our attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and <hi>to count all but loſs and dung for Chriſt:</hi> It was indeed a law-walk to be blameleſs, but it is a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel walk to ſtudy to be blameleſs, and preſſing hard after perfect Holineſs: and yet to foget it, and to be denyed to all conceit of it: and to be deſirous <hi>to be found in Chriſt Jeſus, not having our own righteouſneſs, which is by the Law, but the righteouſneſs which is by Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Particular duties, at leaſt ſome of the duties, that are more particularly called for in this walk and <hi>Converſation becoming the Goſpel:</hi> Ye may take theſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:179825:55"/> ſhortly. The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, a living by Faith: and that is, when a Chriſtian hath Faith, and the exerciſe of it on Chriſt, as it were, another life to him, for though there was a life of faith or of dependance on God in <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, yet not the life of Faith in a Redeemer: <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20) <hi>Yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life that now I live in the flesh, is by faith on the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> And this is to be taken along the Chriſtians walk, even a Continued application to and of Chriſt: This is that which he firſt betakes himſelf to, for Righteouſneſs: yea, when right, he employs him conſtantly, as <hi>He is made of God to him Wiſdome Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption:</hi> As he is ſaid to be made to believers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, the exerciſe of Repentance, which was not called for as a duty by the Law, though much ruine followed the breach of it: This was the ſum of <hi>Johns</hi> and of <hi>Chriſts</hi> preaching: <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand:</hi> Though it be, Alace! a very much ſlighted exerciſe: yet dayly Repentance notably ſuiteth <hi>a Converſation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Goſpel.</hi> 3. A Goſpel-Converſation would be in, and with the exerciſe of Hope: there was love to God under the Law, but not ſo properly the exerciſe of hope; There was, it's true, hope in reſpect of the thing promiſed, in caſe there had been no violation of the Law; but not as reſpecting Chriſt Jeſus, who is the believers hope, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory:</hi> I doubt much if the exerciſe of hope be well known to Chriſtians in this Generation, few <hi>know</hi> what it is to <hi>Hope to the end,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. A <hi>Fourth</hi> Is, the denyall of our ſelves, and the exerciſe of Humility; for as the Goſpel calleth for the denying of our own righteouſneſs, So for the denying of our
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:179825:55"/> own wills, affections, luſts, appetits, and deſires; There is another ſort of love-ſingleneſs and denyedneſs called for now, then under the Law; becauſe <hi>we are bought with a price, and are not our own,</hi> as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>If any man will follow me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> ſaith our Lord <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. A <hi>Fifth</hi> is, much Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That we be crucified to the World, to our ſelf, and to our ſinfull luſts; <hi>I am Crucified</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.) <hi>with Chriſt, yet I live,</hi> ſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. He tells us <hi>that he was crucified to the world, and the World to him:</hi> And he exhorts Chriſtians, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>To Mortifie their members which are upon the Earth: Fornication, Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Inordinat Affection, Covetouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>Sixth</hi> is, Much Patience, Meekneſs, Forbearance, Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; wherein our Lord hath given and left himſelf for a non ſuch Pattern: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29 <hi>Learn</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>of me for I am meek and lowly in heart</hi> So, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22. And hence, Meekneſs, Patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance are ſo much and ſo frequently called for in the Goſpel, and on Goſpel grounds, as great duties becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, or as ſpecial pieces of a Goſpel-conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The <hi>Seventh,</hi> Is, a heavenlineſs in our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, a denyedneſs, a holy abſtractedneſs from earthly things, and living in Heaven, while on earth, and a living more where we love, then where we live: <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Set your affections on things above; not on things on the earth;</hi> Which is alſo called for, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.20. By his own example propoſed for our Pattern, <hi>our Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is in Heaven, whence we look for the Saviour;</hi> To be much in our affections ſet on the things that are on the Earth, to be earthly minded is unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel.

               </gap> 
               <hi>Eighth</hi> is, a great eye on Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an eye, whoſe looks are not bounded within time;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:179825:56"/> but pierce thorow time, and all the Fogs, Miſts, and Clouds that are in it: It's much unbecoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to have our hope much; not to ſay, only, in this life, or to be much taken up about the driving of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſignes and projects: but it's a good qualification of a Goſpel converſation, to have an eye before us on Eternal life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>ult: While</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>We look not on the things that are ſeen; but on the things that are not ſeen, and Eternal.</hi> A <hi>Ninth</hi> is, Much joy in God, much cheerfulneſs and heartſomeneſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believers are willed, <hi>to Rejoyce alway and evermore.</hi> So, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> and <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord alway, and again I ſay rejoyce;</hi> which he ſo much preſſes on them becauſe (as it's like) he knew, that they were given to walk droopingly and heavily, which did not ſo become the Goſpel, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in God, ſinging and making melody in their hearts to him, Cheering themſelves in him; and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting themſelves in the Almighty.</hi> A <hi>Tenth</hi> is, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual contentment, a contented converſation is a <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation becoming the Goſpel: Be careful for nothing</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>But in every thing let your requeſts be made known unto God by Prayer and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with Thanks giving,</hi> and then follows downward a litle, <hi>I have learned, in every State or caſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: I know how to ſuffer want, and how to abound,</hi> &amp;c. This converſation was very becoming the Goſpel; he propoſes himſelf as a pattern herein to them: There are many profeſſors of Religion, who cannot have, but they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e vain; and when they want, they are anxious and diſcouraged; It's hard to carry the Cup even: But a Goſpel-Converſation is equall, ſober and compoſed, and not much up with having, nor much down with want, nor is it eaſily outwitted and non pluſſed by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:179825:56"/> viciſſitudes of thoſe externall things. An <hi>Eleventh</hi> is, Watchfulneſs; a Goſpel-Converſation is a watchfull converſation, and never much Surpriſed or moved: or thus, watching (eſpecially over the heart) joyned with Prayer, is a peculiar duty, that a walk becoming the Goſpel calls for, that we be not found like the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, when his Lord cometh; This is a duty well becoming us who live under the Goſpel, becauſe we have readily ſtronger Corruptions, and are at leaſt under more temptations, then thoſe who lived under the Law. A <hi>Twelfth</hi> is, much Self-examination or ſelf-ſearching becauſe of much corruption in us, and much guilt lying on us, is a duty which the Goſpel calls for; that we may ſee what comes of it; how it is mortified and done away; and there being many Promiſes in our offer, we ſhould ſee what acception they get, and how they are embraced, there is hazard of miſtaking our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtate, &amp;c. All which calls us to be much in this duty, <hi>Examine your ſelves prove your own ſelves,</hi> as ſays the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 13ly. <hi>The making of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure</hi> becomes the Goſpel; when we are hovering, and at an uncertainty as to our ſouls eſtate, we are not only to try it, but to endeavour to put it out of queſtion; I <hi>write theſe things to you</hi> (ſayes <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>That Believe; that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</hi> ye would not only believe, but ſtudy to know that ye believe, that ye may comfort your ſelves in it; and it is a piece of a converſation and walk unbecoming the Goſpel, to hang looſe, in ſuſpenſe, and at an uncertainty, in that greateſt and graveſt buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 14ly. Truſting in God, becomes the Goſpel, and unbelief and diſtruſt of God is unbecoming the Goſpel; <hi>Said I not unto thee;</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Martha John</hi> 11.) <hi>That if thou wouldeſt believe, thou shouldſt ſee the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:179825:57"/> glory of God?</hi> To have a gracious offer from God, and to ſcare at it, as if he were not in earneſt, is very unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the Goſpel; when ever he Pipeth, it becomes us well to dance; and to Believe and Credit him, when he ſpeaks fair and comfortably. 15ly. A Goſpel-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation takes in and calls for, not only Holineſs, but a ſhining examplary Holineſs, Holineſs with a divine Luſtre and ſplendor on it; meerly legal holineſs is dim and dark; and hath litle or no luſter; Therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are called <hi>Children of the light and of the day;</hi> and they are ſaid to <hi>shine as lights, in the midſt of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Generation:</hi> it is not only a Converſation not ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or that is ſomething welfavoured; but ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that is well lyned (to ſpeak ſo) within, with the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and much inherent Grace and Holineſs, and with outward ſelf-denyed, viſible Splendor and glory; <hi>Let your light</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.) <hi>So shine before men,</hi> &amp;c. Even as the glory of his body, when he was transfigured on the Mount, made his Clothes to ſhine, So there is ſomething of Grace within, that makes the external actions and carriage of Believers to ſhine: and words that will be very taſteleſs and ſapleſs from others, though for the matter good, will have another ſort of rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſh and weight from them; and Prayer from their mouth will have another ſort of refreſhful ſweetneſs. 16ly. A Goſpel converſation takes in and calls for much joy in affliction and tribulation; <hi>We rejoyce in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; It will make the Chriſtian <hi>take joyfully the ſpoiling of his goods,</hi> as they did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. It will make men <hi>come from the preſence of Councils rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are accounted worthy to ſuffer for the name of Chriſt,</hi> as it did the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>laſt. My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (ſayes James) <hi>Count it all joy when ye fall into
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:179825:57"/> divers temptations,</hi> or tribulations: It makes pleaſant and heartſome bearing of Croſſes from God, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries from men; It makes the Chriſtian ſtoop humbly and very low to theſe; It will not ſuffer him to render evil for evil, but will put him to do good for evil, and it makes him do it on a Goſpel ground and account; becauſe Chriſt frankly forgave the Chriſtian <hi>ten thouſand Talents</hi> of his debt: he is ready to forgive, <hi>an hundred pence</hi> of petty and inconſiderable injuries done againſt him. 17ly. A Goſpel converſation is a ſweet, quiet, peaceable, well humoured Converſation, it makes men and women good to live with, It hath much love and pity to them that are without, it's a good neighbour, it's a great friend to unity and a great enemy to diviſion: it preſſes hard <hi>after ſtanding faſt in on Spirit..</hi> 18ly. A Goſpel-converſation implyes a ſetled, fixed condition, that is not fleeting and wavering: It ſuffers not Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to be one thing to day and another thing to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, very unbecoming the Goſpel: a Goſpel-converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not ſuffer a man to be a temporizer, or one that cometh and goeth with every turn of the tyde, to be of any Party that is upmoſt: but puts to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made him free:</hi> the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers heart is fixed, and his converſation is ſtable, when it is, as it becometh the Goſpel. 19ly. It's a bold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that will ſcare at no tryal for Chriſt, but will hazard and venture far, ere it expoſe the Goſpel to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproach; Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. <hi>In nothing being terrified by your adverſaries:</hi> It is very loth to do or to forbear any thing, that may make the Goſpel to be evil ſpoken of. 20ly. It is a Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, or a walking in the Spirit, as the word is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Walk in the ſpirit</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>And ye shall not fulfill the luſts of the flesh,</hi> and Verſ. 25. <hi>If we
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179825:58"/> live in the Spirit let us walk in the Spirit:</hi> It makes us to pray in the Spirit, to praiſe in the Spirit: and by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, it puts upon endeavours to do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is called for. 21ly. A Goſpel converſation is a wreſtling and fighting converſation, ſtriving and warring againſt temptations without, and a body of death within: a lazie ſecure, whole-hearted converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when a perſon is lying by, and is not ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt, nor purifieing himſelf from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, but at truce with corruption, is not ſure, becoming the Goſpel: Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. hath ſuch a combate with the remainder of indwelling corruption, Sometimes complaining of: ſometimes Proteſting againſt it, and ſometimes bitterly bemoaning and crying out under its captivating power: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Believer two contrary parties, one of Grace and another of corrupt nature, which are contrary one to another, as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. A Believer in a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Converſation is like <hi>Jacobs</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> Strugling in the womb: It is for this cauſe that, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. All the pieces of the Spirituall armour are particularly deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Chriſtians, as Chriſts ſouldiers, commanded to put them on: and to have a Goſpel-converſation is to be improving all the pieces of that compleat Armour of God aright, to their ſeveral ends.</p>
            <p>Theſe are things (and ſuch others) that are parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly called for in a Goſpel-walk and converſation: and if we would take a litle view of them all together, and gather the meaning of this <hi>uſe of Inſtruction,</hi> from the exhortation, <hi>Let your converſation be, as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> the Sum of it may be briefly given in theſe <hi>Four,</hi> 1. To be exactly ſtudying Holineſs. 2. To be denyed to our Holineſs, as <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 3. To be eſpecially taken up with thoſe particular
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179825:58"/> duties, of living by Faith, of exerciſing Repentance, of aiming at and cloſely purſuing after Communion with God in Chriſt Jeſus; (which is, though a much abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duty and unworthily proſtituted in the mouths of many, a moſt precious both duty and priviledge,) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing Hope, Self-denyall, &amp;c: So that we may be in caſe warrantably to ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 4. To be much in the Exerciſe of all theſe, heartſomely and chearfully, and to be comforted and refreſhed in doing duty, and yet denyed to all our doing: A Chriſtian, having a ſuitable Converſation to the Goſpel, Sees his ills and is humbled, obſerves Gods goodneſs and Comforts himſelf, and bleſſes God hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for his goodneſs in reſpect of both, and becauſe there is hope of an outgate from all his evils, and a day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he ſhall be finally and fully Redeemed from all his iniquities.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Uſe</hi> Leads us to <hi>Regrate</hi> and <hi>Expoſtulat</hi> with hearers and Profeſſors of the Goſpel, of this time; Though this be the thing and the <hi>only</hi> thing that they are called to, yet if we ſhould go through and view the Converſation of the moſt part; O! how very unſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unbecoming is it to the Goſpel, even ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, that if our hearts were tender, they would break and bleed within us to behold it; but Alace! it is a part of our unſuitableneſs, that we cannot ſuitably lament it: Litle zeal for God, and ſorrow for what dishonours him and reflects on the Profeſſion of his Name, are much gone from this generation: Oh! whither ſhall we go, into the City or Countrey, to find a Converſation becoming the Goſpel? We cannot be without ſome conviction, that we ought to be zealous
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179825:59"/> for the glory of God, and ſerious in the ſtudy of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all manner of Converſation, that the Goſpel be not reproached and blaſphemed: if we be ſo, and if ſuch a Converſation be a duty and a very reaſonable duty; how comes it to be ſo little minded and made conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of? If we profeſs Chriſt to be our Husband and head, our Captain and leader, ought we not to be like him, and follow him? I take it for granted, that this will be generally aſſented to, as being very juſt and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; and yet without accompliſhing a very diligent ſearch into our own way, may we not find at the firſt view much, very Lamentably much unſuitableneſs in our walk to the Goſpel? Need we deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars? is not our unſuitableneſs obvious, palpable and undenyable? Let me but ask our ſelves a few queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: are we making ſuitable uſe of the promiſes and often meditating on them? Are we taken up with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting our ſelves in God, and in the great and excellent things contained in the promiſes? Do we ſtudy to be like them, and ſuitably to improve them! Do we ſtudy to have thoſe poor performances of duty that we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſo qualified as the Goſpel calls for? the lifeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and whole heartedneſs, that manifeſtly diſcover themſelves, in our very hearing of theſe things, declare much what we are; your Miniſters are ſome way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and puzled how to deal with you: and know not well whether to ſpeak or to be ſilent, whether to pipe or to mourn; what ſuitableneſs is there to the Goſpel, when the converſation of many is ſo ſpotted? So far, Alace! are we from ſhining, that we are rather like blind lanthorns without light. I ſhall only for whetting an edge on this ſad regrate and expoſtulation, inſtance in a few of theſe Particulars touched on before, as to our unſuitableneſs to the Goſpel. 1. Do we live by
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179825:59"/> faith? Alace! is there ſuch a life as this known by moſt of us? we are readily either living ſecurely, careleſly and unconcernedly, without troubling our ſelves with ſuch matters: or elſe on the other hand we give way to unbelief and will hardly admit of any thing, that may ſettle and make us foot a ſtand: we are found often run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from one extremity to another, we are either car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally vain, light and frothy, or we are anxious, heartleſs and dejected, and are very ſeldome found ſteering a ſtraight courſe betwixt extremes and ſtemming the port. 2. We may inſtance it in the exerciſe of Repentance, which well becomes the Goſpel: Our Lord Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and the Apoſtles preached it, and it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to all: It is an exerciſe very ſuitable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for ſinners, and more eſpecially for ſuch ſinners, as have had many offers of Grace, and have much ſlighted them: but where is it? Ah! where is it? Converts are rare in theſe dayes, and among Converts the kindly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Repentance is rare: we are generally as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, as if we were living under the Covenant, where there is no promiſe of pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>don to a penitent ſinner: I mean not every ſort of repentance, for there is a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow that works death, there is a legal Repen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance ariſing mainly, if not only from the fear of puniſhment: But I mean of ſerious and hearty Goſpel-repentance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the conſideration of Gods holineſs, and of his Mercy and grace in Jeſus Chriſt, that is accompanied with holy zeal, fear, indignation and revenge, as it is deſcribed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3. Where is ſelf-denyall? Is not that a rare thing? Many of us cannot bear a word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on <hi>ſelf,</hi> neither can we quit a word once uttered by us (though it may be ſomewhat raſhly and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly) wherein <hi>ſelf</hi> is Concerned, but will needs maintain and defend it: O! what reeling and whirling
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:179825:60"/> about with the time is there among us? What hard purſuing after and even chaſing of ſelf-intereſts and deſignes? 4. Where is ſpirituall joy and rejoicing in the Lord? who delight themſelves in the Almighty? who bleſs themſelves on earth, in the God of truth? Who do really and humbly boaſt in Him all the day-long? who bleſs themſelves in, and think themſelves well come to, with Precious Jeſus Chriſt as their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Redeemer, as their Lord, head, and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? who rejoyce and glory in the midſt of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the hope of the glory of God? joy in externall things is much withered away from us, and it is juſt with God that it ſhould be ſo, ſince we live ſo great ſtrangers to the joy of the Lord, <hi>which is our ſtrength;</hi> upon but a very overly tryall, we will eaſily diſcover that there is amongſt us none, or but very little ſpirituall joy in God; I mean not only, nor ſo much of ſenſible joy, as of our litle active ſtirring up of our ſelves to give obedience to that Command concerning <hi>rejoycing in God alway and evermore.</hi> May I not conclude then, that there is great ground of expoſtulation with us all, both believers and others, who may be convinced, that this lyeth indiſpenſibly on them, even to have a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation as it becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt? Ah! how litle conſcience is made of it: O! mourn for and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our ſhort-comings, as to this: and fall to the work, fall about it more then ever, as your main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to have a converſation becoming the Goſpel: many already are a reproach and a ſhame to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, (and it will diſclaim them) and who ſhall live to ſee it, a great many moe will be ſo; Alace! few or none of us all have a Converſation as becomes the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is a Lamentation and ſhould be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Third Uſe</hi> is, of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> that ſeeing ſuch a converſation is ſo much, and with ſuch ſpeciality cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, and yet ſo litle ſeriouſly endeavoured by moſt; let me turn over to you the Apoſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> exhortation to the <hi>Philippians:</hi> if ye would know how to behave at home and abroad, in the duties of Worſhip, and in the duties of your particular callings, ſtations and relations, even in all Commanded Duties; then, <hi>Only let your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be, as it becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt:</hi> And beware of doing any thing that is unbecoming the Goſpel: or that may give ground to ſpeak any ill of it; beware of letting the precious Promiſes ly by you unimproved; but ſtudy to be like them: O ſtudy Holineſs in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation; which is, not only and ſimply to be Holy or to have Holineſs, but a Holineſs influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the Goſpel-promiſes in Chriſt, believingly improved, as the Apoſtle exhorts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Not only to be externally holy, but to be in the exerciſe of the graces of the Spirit within; to cleanſe from all filthineſs of the Spirit, as well as of the fleſh, eſpecially to purify the heart the fountain of Pollution, even to ſtudy to be pure as he is pure, to aime at Holineſs in the ſtrength of Chriſt, in the largeſt extent and in the Higheſt pitch, and yet to be denyed to it and all vain conceit of it, even to account it but loſs, in the point of Juſtification before God; to be in the Practice of all the duties of Religion Sweetly, Pleaſantly, Heartſomely and cheerfully, walking under all ſorts of lots with a Goſpel contentedneſs: This, O! this would be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation worthy of, and becoming the Goſpel, nay it would make a litle Heaven on earth. And we deſire to to be as preſſing and peremptory in calling for this from you, as ever we urgently preſſed you by any call or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to receive the offer of the Goſpel and of Chriſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179825:61"/> therein; and if we were to ſpeak to you all, O Men and women, one by one, by name and Sirname, this would be our Exhortation to you; <hi>Only let your Converſation be as it becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now, (as we promiſed) to preſs this on you by ſome few <hi>Conſiderations:</hi> And <hi>Firſt</hi> Conſider the authority that enjoins it and lays it on you; and if ye truſt him, and expect the accompliſhment of any promiſe of the Goſpel from him, then take this as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the ſame Authority; preſume not under the pain of Gods diſpleaſure, and of cheating your own ſouls to their ruine, to take or medle with the promiſe, if ye mind not ſincerely to ſtudy a ſuitableneſs in your converſation to the Goſpel. 2. Conſider, not only the reaſonableneſs of the thing, but alſo the ſweet eaſineſs of it; for taking it in a Goſpel ſenſe, it's an eaſy yoke and a light burden: and it's withall very ſuitable and congruous to all profeſſors of the Goſpel: ought not a Miniſter to be like his calling, a Merchant to be like his calling, a Tradesman to be like his trade and calling? ought not alſo a Chriſtian to be like his Chriſtian call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, like the Goſpel which he profeſſeth? 3. Conſider the tyes and obligations, that all who profeſſe to have received the Goſpel, are under: are ye not obliged to ſuch a Converſation, by your Baptiſmal Vow? which obligation, though many of you forget, yet God will require it; Think ye that ye are free to live as ye liſt, to live like the Goſpel or not, or to take one Piece of a Goſpel walk, and leave another? Ye are Profeſſedly reſigned to God in Baptiſme, and are by it oblidged to live every way as it becometh the Goſpel; and ye muſt either on the matter renounce your Baptiſme and deny Chriſt, and ſo deal treacherouſly with him, or ye muſt make it your buſineſs to live like the Goſpel. 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:179825:61"/> that this Goſpel will be the rule whereby ye ſhal be judged, whether ye have indeed received the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, The promiſes and priviledges, the duties and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the graces of it, and improved them or not; <hi>in the day</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) <hi>That God shall judge the ſecrets of hearts by my Goſpel:</hi> If ye would have boldneſs when death and Judgement come, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour a converſation becoming this Goſpel: though your converſation were very much becoming the law (as it is impoſſible now without Goſpel grace) yet will not that ſatisfie the Judge; for ye will be Judged both by the law and Goſpel. 5. Conſider, that though the Lord had required many hard things of you; you would moſt certainly have been oblidged to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them; and now when he requires only this, ought ye not ſo much the more to aim at it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it? Otherwiſe ye bring up an ill report on this Goſpel, as if it were an unſupportable heavy burden, and moſt uneaſiy yoke; for which ye muſt anſwer at your peril; conſider the dreadful doom and ſentence of the ſlothful Servant, Who ſaid, <hi>He is a hard Maſter.</hi> 6. Conſider the great prejudice that a walk unbecoming the Goſpel hath with it; I cannot eaſily, nay not at all to the full, tell you the prejudice it will bring to you; Only this I will ſay, that it had been better for you, that ye had never heard the Goſpel; It had been better that ye never had been piped to by the Goſpel, and that ye had never heard any of its ſweeteſt muſick-ſprings, if (to follow the Lords own ſimilitude ſo far) ye endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not to keep all the meaſures thereof in your danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, in your walking conforme to it: Tell me, if we may be in earneſt with you: what if ye were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even now or before night to give an account of your improving of and profiting by the Goſpel, whereof ye
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179825:62"/> have ſo very much, and from which ye have been ſo often piped unto, how utterly unanſwerable would many of you be found to be? your triffling way of walking alone and in your families, your neglecting of Prayer in them, with the chiding and bitterneſs betwixt husbands and wives, and with and amongſt ſervants; your omitting to inſtruct children and Servants in the principles of Religion; your tipling and miſ-ſpending your time, declare ſufficiently what your Converſation is. If any of you ſhall ſay, the converſation that you preſs, is a harder work and a more difficult taske then we can win at; Is it any thing elſe, then what the Holy Ghoſt by the Apoſtle preſſeth on all the hearers of the Goſpel? Q! take heed of branding a walk becoming the Goſpel with ſo black a note, as if it were an unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable yoke of intolerable hard bondage, leſt it be ſaid to you, <hi>evil and ſlothfull Servants,</hi> &amp;c. if ye had been Serious and diligent in making uſe of the Goſpel in a Goſpel way, by improving Chriſt and the Promiſes, this work would have gone better with you, and ye had been in much better caſe then ye are in now: If ye had been more in the practiſe of Goſpel duties and in the exerciſe of Goſpel-graces in ſecre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, your viſible conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation might and would have been much more as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>As for you that have Communicat, there is a peculiar tye upon you, you have renewed your Covenant with God: and is there any covenanting with God but it hath this in it, That if there be thereafter a falling back ſuch back ſliders come under the guilt of treacherous dealing with him? Let me, for a concluſion of this Diſcourſe, ſay theſe few things to you; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it ſuitable, think ye, to faſt the one day for your not walking as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel, and to take unjuſt liberty to your
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:179825:62"/> ſelves the next day? on a faſt day to ſpue out your foul and abominable ſins, and to return with the dog to the vomit in a few dyes thereafter? will ye be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable to your profeſſions and confeſſions? beware of that, for the Lords ſake: better ye had never faſted nor confeſſed, then thus to mock the Lord. 2. Many of you have been at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and in it ye have profeſſed that ye have taken Chriſt for your husband, which implies the tye and obligation of a dutiful wife: what, I pray, is That, but <hi>to have a Converſation as becomes the Goſpel,</hi> and to <hi>walk worthy of the Vocation wherewith ye are called?</hi> As the Apoſtle Exhorts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.1. And is there any ſtraiter bond on earth whereby men can be bound? If, after thus Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Chriſt, ye ſhall foully fail or fall back, will it not exceedingly aggrege your guilt? 3. Are there not of you who have come under ſome private engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Lord? I take it for granted, if ye have not been ſcorning God in your humiliation, and in your Communicating: I take it (I ſay) for granted, that ſeverals of you have come under particular and perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all engagements to God: If ſo, ye would beware of looſing thoſe tyes, and of violating thoſe ſo Solemn engagements: and the rather, that it is to be feared, if ye keep not promiſe to God now, ye may never get a Communion again to renew it. 4.

               </gap> thing, then, for the moſt part, it is taken to be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179825:63"/> and, no queſtion, were we often thinking on, and ſtudying the qualifications and extent of a Chriſtian converſation, to which believers are called; we would walk with ſtopped mouths in the deep ſenſe of our great ſhort-coming; and there would not be ſuch deluſion under the conceit of ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; But the ignorance of this makes carnall men think themſelves to be ſomething; and makes even believers themſelves, that they walk not ſo humbly, nor preſs ſo ſeriouſly towards the mark, neither do they Propoſe to themſelves, as they ought, a juſt and perfect pattern to follow.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other qualifications of a Chriſtian-walk and converſation, This is one and a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one; that <hi>our Converſation should be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> A thing we fear the moſt part of the Chriſtians of this age ſcarcely believe, much leſs endeavour, that they ſhould live with their hearts above in Heaven, in the lively expectation of the Saviours coming, That they ſhould converſe in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, before they come thither.</p>
            <p>The Scope of theſe words is plain. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath to do with the Chriſtian <hi>Philippians,</hi> who were much tempted, and no doubt, in ſome hazard to be led aſide both from the faith, and from the Practiſe of Religion: And the way that he takes to keep them right as to both, is by propoſing His own example to them; as if he had ſaid, ye will readily think, that I ſhould be well acquainted with the way to Heaven: Now the way that I take
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:179825:64"/> for my Juſtification Before God, is not to ſeek after Righteouſneſs by the works of the Law, but to be found in Chriſt covered with his righteouſneſs taken hold of by Faith: And if ye would know what I do in reference to Sanctification, this is it, <hi>I forget thoſe things that are behind, and reach forth unto thoſe things that are before, preſſing towards the Mark for the Prize;</hi> being conſtantly as it were on the ſpur, that I may attain that which I have not as yet come at, even that perfection of Holineſs, <hi>that accompanies the reſurrection from the dead:</hi> And having laid this before them, as a fair copy and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; He improves it, by exhorting them thus, <hi>Brethren be ye followers together of me;</hi> take the way, that I take, both in the matter of Faith and of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; And he gives two reaſons why he would have them to do ſo; The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is taken from the danger that was in following thoſe falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Many of whom walk ſo, as they are Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi> That is, enemies to the doctrine of faith in Chriſt, and to the exerciſe of it on him, and to the Doctrine of his Croſs, and alſo to a truly ſpiritual walk, <hi>Whoſe end is diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whoſe God is their Belly.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> Reaſon is ſubjoyned in the <hi>Text,</hi> drawn from the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which they ſhould have by following him, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>Our converſation is in Heaven:</hi> This is the ſpiritual, Heavenly and divine walk, wherein he holds forth himſelf, and his fellow-Apoſtles as a pattern to be imitated by them, and ſo teacheth them their duty; We are not (as if he had ſaid)
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:179825:64"/> like thoſe falſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ſation is in Heaven,</hi> Therefore follow us; and he gives an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this in the latter part of the <hi>Verſe, From whence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>We look for the Saviour:</hi> He is like a perſon on the Watch tower, that is looking and longing for the coming of a friend; Plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating thereby, that he looks not for much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in this world, but was earneſtly longing for and in continuall expectation of Chriſts coming; to which all his hope and expectation of compleat happineſs, and of full ſatisfaction to his ſoul, was cloſely confined.</p>
            <p>So then the great thing that he aimes at here, is to commend a heavenly converſation, to theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Philippians,</hi> &amp; to all that ſhould hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and this excellent piece of it amongſt the reſt.</p>
            <p>There are only <hi>Two</hi> things ſhortly to be cleared, before we proceed further; The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, What is meaned by <hi>Converſation</hi> here; And the reaſon of the queſtion is, becauſe the word is ſo very ſignificant in the Original, that hardly can we get a word in our language to expreſs it by to the life; It's taken from that which ſignifies a Town-ſhip, corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-ship (to ſpeak ſo) or Burges-ship; and it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes theſe <hi>two</hi> things; <hi>Firſt,</hi> a title to ſuch and ſuch priviledges; as thoſe who were <hi>Romans</hi> or born Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; whoever were made Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of it; had ſuch and ſuch Priviledges attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Burges-ship. The <hi>Second</hi> is a ſuitableneſs and peculiar manner of living and carrying accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lawes of that City; as it is often ſaid in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:179825:65"/> the book of <hi>the Acts of the Apoſtles, After the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Romans:</hi> who had their own lawes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and uſages: and being applied here in a Spiritual ſenſe, it ſuppoſes. 1. A joint intereſt with the ſaints, (or being <hi>Fellow Citizens with the Saints:</hi> As it is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.19.) Who are all Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of the Heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though ſome of them be, as it were, in the Suburbs and lower Town, and ſome in the Higher; yet all here below have the ſame Maſter and Father with them who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in Heaven. 2. It ſuppoſeth a way, walk, and converſation like Heaven, to be peculiarly indued with a nature, inclinations, deſires, deſignes, and qualifications ſuitable to heaven: We take it here, eſpecially in the latter ſenſe: becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> propoſeth himſelf as a pattern to them to imitat; and it holds his ſuitableneſs to Heaven.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing to be cleared a litle is, what it is to have a converſation in Heaven? I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> theſe <hi>Two</hi> are in effect one and the ſame, to have a converſation in heaven, and to be Heavenly in our converſation: it's even to have a converſation like that which Chriſtians hope to have in Heaven, and ſuch as are bounden, and on their way thitherward, should have: This is a generall hint of what a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Converſation, or a Converſation in Heaven is: and becauſe, in proſecuting the Doctrines to be deduced from the words, we will have occaſion to explain it More Particularly, we shall ſay no more of it now.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrines</hi> that ariſe from the words, are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:179825:65"/> eſpecially theſe <hi>Four:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is, that <hi>There is a ſort of Heavenlineſs, in the Converſation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that should be ſtudied by them all without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that lyeth on them all as their duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is, that, <hi>This Heavenlineſs of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in a great meaſure through Grace attainable:</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> and other believers attained it; which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if there were an univerſall ſuitableneſs; or a ſuitableneſs in all things, in ſojourning Saints, to Glorified Saints in Heaven; for in Heaven they do not eat nor drink, neither are they married nor given in Marriage: But it's to be underſtood of a ſuitableneſs in reſpect of qualification, conformity and likeneſs, in ſo far as is incumbent to ſojourners who are walking thither-ward.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is, That, <hi>It is a peculiar and contradiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing mark of a ſerious and ſuitably exerciſed Chriſtian, from all other men in the world: That his converſation is in Heaven, while that of others is not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, That, <hi>It's not an ordinary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but a rare thing among Profeſſed Chriſtians, to have a Converſation in Heaven, Many</hi> (ſayes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>Walk, of whom I have told you, and now tell you weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt:</hi> But I and ſome few others with me <hi>have our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in Heaven:</hi> and the <hi>many</hi> that he ſpeaks of here, we take to be thoſe, of whom he ſpeaks in the <hi>Firſt Chapter,</hi> who preached Chriſt, but out of envy, and preſſed Holineſs, it is like with more then ordinary fervour, being zealous of the Law, and ſeeking to mix the righteouſneſs of it with the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in the point of Juſtification: yet they had not their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven, as he and ſome others had.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not proſecute theſe Doctrines diſtinctly:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179825:66"/> ſeeing this is the ſcope of them all, even to hold forth and commend the Neceſſity and excellency of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly converſation: which we ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> clear. 2 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: and then. 3. We ſhall ſpeak to the <hi>Uſe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> Then, for <hi>Clearing</hi> what a Heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is, ye would conſider, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of his owne and of ſome few other Godly perſons their converſation, in oppoſition to thoſe many mentioned by him before: And it imports or implies theſe <hi>Four. Firſt</hi> it's to have Heaven propoſed to our ſelves as our great Scope and deſigne, next to the glory of God; even as, to have an earthly Converſation, is to mind earthly things, to have a bentneſs of ſpirit towards them, and to be wholly or Moſtly taken up about the things of the World: So to be Heavenly in our Converſation, is to have the mind taken up about Heaven, Prizing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and ſeeking after Heaven and Heavenly things, as the word is, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Seek after, or ſet your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on thoſe things that are above. Secondly,</hi> As it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, Prizing and affecting of Heaven and of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, ſo it imports the taking of that way that leads to the end: and ſo it is, to be in the uſe of all means and duties that lead to Heaven, <hi>ſeek</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, in that <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Thoſe things that are above: Set your affections on things above, not on things beneath,</hi> or <hi>on the earth:</hi> To hold forth the earneſtneſs and ardency of affections that Chriſtians ought to have towards things heavenly: and how very much they ſhould be with Holy care and ſolicitude, buſied in the uſe of all means, and in the Practice of all duties, for the furthering and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of an Heavenly deſigne: even as worldly men are taken up and exerciſed with carking cares, leaving (as it were) no ſtone unmoved to promove and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs their earthly deſignes. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It imports the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179825:66"/> having of our Converſation <hi>like</hi> heaven, to be walking like thoſe that are in Heaven: not to be conformed to the World, or like the men of the world, but to be like Angels and Glorified Saints in Heaven, according to our Capacitie: as we are taught to pray, in the Lords Prayer, <hi>They will be done on earth, as it is done in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> It's to have a native and kindly ſuitableneſs and proportionableneſs to them that are glorified in Heaven. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It imports this, that we ſhould be often in Heaven as to our thoughts and affections, as to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and delights: Though we be living on the earth: that we ſhould have as it were, more then our one half in heaven: as <hi>David</hi> hath it <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Unto thee O Lord, do I lift up my ſoul:</hi> or as the Word is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Though we be <hi>abſent in the Body,</hi> that yet we may be ſome way preſent in our Spirits with the Lord; that we ſhould make frequent viſits to Heaven; that we ſhould have much to do there, have much Traffique, commerce, correſpondence and intercourſe in and with Heaven; that (in a word) we ſhould converſe more where we love, then where we live: which is held forth and expreſſed in the Scripture, by <hi>walking with God,</hi> by <hi>having fellowship with him,</hi> by <hi>following hard after him,</hi> and the like: a ſuitableneſs to and a converſe in Heaven are mainly meant here.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Second</hi> thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> of this, that a Chriſtian ſhould ſtudy this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Converſation; the Argument is clear and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from <hi>Verſ.</hi> 17. Where the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to <hi>be followers of him,</hi> and here he tells them that <hi>his Converſation is in Heaven:</hi> and if his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was in Heaven, then certainly it was their duty and is ours, to have our Converſation in Heaven; for he propoſeth himſelf as our pattern in this, and we have
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:179825:67"/> it, from the Spirit of God, by him preſſed on us as our duty, to imitat him in this thing; It is not ſo ſingular a practice; as to be peculiarized, Monopoliz'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed to him alone; but ſuch as was common to him, and other ſerious Chriſtians according to their meaſure; Therefore he ſays not, <hi>My</hi> Converſation, but <hi>Our</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; as if he had ſaid, it's mine and the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of others, and of all that follow me; and I would have you in this to follow me and none other that doth not walk as I do. If it be needfull further to confirme it, ye may take this one reaſon, which hath ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the boſom of it; A Chriſtians Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be Heavenly, becauſe, <hi>all that a Chriſtian hath, is from and in Heaven, and is ſome way Heavenly;</hi> as will manifeſtly appear, if ye look, <hi>firſt</hi> to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans nature, it's from Heaven; He is <hi>Partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> He is <hi>born of God,</hi> He is <hi>of the new Jeruſalem,</hi> his <hi>Father is Heavenly,</hi> as he is taught to pray; <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> Or our <hi>Heavenly Father;</hi> to point out, <hi>that as we have born the Image of the earthly, ſo muſt we bear the Image of the Heavenly,</hi> as it is. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. Where is the elder Brother? Is he not in <hi>the Heavenly places?</hi> As the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.6. His <hi>Treaſure is in Heaven;</hi> His <hi>hope is in Heaven; Heaven</hi> is the <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Manſion,</hi> the <hi>reſt</hi> whither He is travelling, or if <hi>Secondly,</hi> ye conſider the Believers calling and his obligation: Thereby he is <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Heavenly calling:</hi> (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1.) Separated from the reſt of the world, and therefore ought not to live as the world doth; He hath a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly law to walk by: he hath Heavenly promiſes, to feed and live upon, and to comfort himſelf in; his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is Heavenly; and all the Duties that he is called to are ſo; of which this is the ſubſtance and ſum, even
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:179825:67"/> to <hi>glorifie God,</hi> and to ſeek to <hi>enjoy him,</hi> and ſo to ſhine in his Converſation, as others may be provoked to glorifie God: are not his prayers and praiſes Heavenly? and can a believer poſſibly go aright about thoſe, and not be Heavenly? to be <hi>Tranſlated from darkneſs to light,</hi> to be <hi>a partaker of the Sanctifieing ſpirit of God, to be a new Creature,</hi> to have <hi>the ſpirit of Adoption, to have boldneſs of acceſs to God,</hi> to be <hi>an Heir and a joint-Heir with Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. Are not theſe Heavenly? Or if <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We look to his company, is it not Heavenly? <hi>We are come</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.) <hi>To God the Judge of all, to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant, to the new Jeruſalem,</hi> (which taketh in all the Saints in Heaven, &amp; the Saints on earth) to an <hi>innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, to the general aſſembly of the firſt born, &amp; to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> In a word, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we look to, whether to the Believers nature, or to his end, or to the rule of his walk, or to the Promiſes, or to his work and way wherein he is to go; all is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: is there not an oblidging neceſſity on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, in reſpect of all theſe, to ſtudy to be Heavenly in his Converſation? Which is the great thing that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preſſeth on you; and from theſe words is clearly preſſed on all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Uſes</hi> are <hi>Four;</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof ſerves for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> and <hi>Infirmation</hi> to all that bear the Name of Chriſt; know from this, what is the high pitch of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that ye are called to, It is even to be Heavenly in your Converſation; are there not many who have much need to be inſtructed in this? Who never walked under the Conviction of the neceſſity of this as a duty; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, were it poſſible, that the moſt part of men and women, who are called Chriſtians and profeſs a hope of Heaven, could or durſt live as they do, ſome in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:179825:68"/> Prophanity Riotouſneſs and gluttony; others in meer civility and Morall Honeſty; and others in Formality and Hypocriſie at the beſt? Let me ask you in good earneſt, are ye not convinced that this is a duty? or do you think that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſcorning or complementing, when he exhorts to follow him in this? Or is it poſſible that ye can enjoy ſo many Heavenly priviledges, or be to any purpoſe performing heavenly duties, except ye be Heavenly in your Converſation? And if ſo, Miſtake not Chriſtianity, as if when ye are exhorted to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ye were only bidden not to be prophane; or only to go about the externall duties of Religion; or only to have a ſort of meerly Moral ſincerity, and ſeriouſneſs in the performing of them; which are indeed things good in themſelves, and we do not, we dare not diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, but rather commend them; but ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to more, to much more, and that is to be <hi>Heavenly-minded and to have your Converſation in Heaven.</hi> I know ſome are ſo profane, and others are ſo misbelievingly diſcouraged, that when they hear ſuch doctrine as this, they will be ready, the one ſort to ſay, <hi>We cannot all be Saints;</hi> and the other, <hi>Alace! we cannot be Saints:</hi> but let all ſuch mouths be ſtopped; ye are called and oblidged indiſpenſibly to be Saints: and if ye be not Saints here, ye ſhall never be Saints hereafter: There are alſo ſome of ſo diſtempered diſpoſitions and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, that they either put off all or moſt duties, or at leaſt go very heartleſly about them, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attain perfection in them; but it's clear from the Scriptures, that there is a kind of Perfection to be win at here in this life, which is even this Holineſs and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs of Converſation: When ye ſhall be called to a reckoning, God will not ask you ſo much, whether ye did not Drink drunk, Whore, Swear, Lie, Cheat,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:179825:68"/> Steal, or the like, as whether ye were Heavenly in your Converſation? and this is not to be aſtricted to one, or to ſome few particular duties; but is the requiſit qualification of a Chriſtian in all duties and in all his actions: whether he be Praying, Practiſing, Hearing, Reading, Buying, Selling, Eating, Drinking, &amp;c. Or whatever He do and be about, he is to be Heavenly in all thoſe.</p>
            <p>And if ye <hi>Ask</hi> more particularly; <hi>what that is?</hi> I ſhall ſhew you, in what reſpect a Chriſtian may be ſaid to have and ſhould have his Converſation in Heaven. And <hi>Firſt;</hi> in reſpect of the inward Holy frame and Divine ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Joining with <hi>the four beaſts and four and twenty Elders;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty:</hi> to be much in prizing and valuing of God, in ſetting out and commending him: to be in all duties willing and cheerfull, doing Gods will cheerfully and with alacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:179825:69"/> and mind in Heaven, when ye ly down, and ſeeking to find it there, when ye ariſe. 2. To have your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, love, deſires and delights in Heaven, or heavenly. 3. To have your words ſavouring of Heaven; <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering Grace to the hearers;</hi> endeavouring to have your words weighty and grave in the commendation of God and his Grace. 4. To have your hearing of the word, and your praying, carrying much of a heavenly ſtamp and impreſſion on them; hearing, as if God were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you Immediatly from heaven, and praying; as if ye were even before his Throne. 5. In your more common and ordinary Converſation, as in your Eating and Drinking, in your recreating, and in following your lawful callings and employments, even the very courſeſt and loweſt of them, to propoſe to your ſelves another end, then the men of the world do, making that your main end to <hi>Glorifie God;</hi> and to have ſuch a heavenly and Divine way of going about theſe, as may be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, edifieing and gaining of on-lookers; not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominantly influenced by ſelfiſh humours, deſignes or intereſts, looking only, or mainly, to what may pleaſe or profit your ſelves, but levelling all at the Glory of God, and the edification and good of others, as well as your own. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may be ſaid to have our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven, when we have a Holy commerce and trading (as it were) with Heaven; as a man is ſaid to converſe in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> when he trades and trafliques there; So, to have converſe in Heaven, is Spiritually to traffique there; to have Faith and Hope exerciſed in and about heaven, to ſend many prayers and deſires to heaven, as ſo many empty veſſels; and to be in the lively and longing expectation of their return full and richly loaden; to make many viſits (as I ſaid before) to heaven; and to be in all thoſe, neither
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:179825:70"/> ſeldome, nor tranſiently and at ſtarts only, but to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and more continuing in them; and though they ſhould ſometimes return either with ſeeming loſſe, or with very litle gain, yet to keep up the trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique, ſeeking to make up our loſſe by a new voyage thither: for the trade is not alwayes (to ſpeak ſo) alike quick. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We may be ſaid to converſe in heaven, by our abiding (as it were) in heaven; and this is one of the higheſt ſteps of a heavenly Converſation. If ye ſhall <hi>ask</hi> How it is, that a believer, while on earth, doth or can abide in Heaven? I <hi>Anſwer</hi> theſe wayes, or in theſe reſpects: 1. By having his heart in heaven, where his treaſure is; <hi>For</hi> (as the Lord ſayes) <hi>Where a mans treaſure is, there is his heart:</hi> the man (as it were) dwels there, and if at any time he remove a litle, he leaves there his great ſtock, and his heart as a Factor: ſo, though the Chriſtian be diſcourſing, buying, ſelling, eating, drinking &amp;c. Yet in all theſe, his heart may and ought ſome way to be in heaven. 2. To have his Faith in heaven, and, as it were, never to come out of it. 3. To have his love in heaven, folding its two armes about the Lamb and him that ſits on the Throne; holily loth to have them looſed from thoſe ſweet Soul ſolac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſatisfieing embraces. 4. To have his hope in heaven, which is <hi>an Anchor caſt within the vail,</hi> and makes the ſoul ſafe and ſure amidſt the greateſt tempeſts of outward trouble, as a ſhip rideth ſafely when ſhe hath caſt Anchor on firme ground, ſo that there is no fear ſhe will drive. In a word, theſe <hi>Four,</hi> The <hi>Heart, Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> being in heaven, we may ſay that the mans beſt half and Part is in heaven: his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edder ſtake is looſed, and much of his Tabernacle taken down, and he made in a good meaſure meet, ready and ripe for his diſſolution and for heaven: Thus ye are called and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179825:70"/> oblidged to have your Converſation in heaven. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A Believers converſation may be ſaid to be, and ought to be in heaven, when his contentment, delight and ſatisfaction are in heaven; when all that he deſires, all that he delights in, and on which his ſoul feeds, and all that he is comforted with, is in heaven, and he hath not a day to do well, nor one comfortable good hour, but that which is given him from heaven: and this is not only to be abiding with, but to be delighting in God: having <hi>the peace of God that paſſeth underſtanding, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart,</hi> and <hi>His love shed abroad therein:</hi> and having all that which entertains his life, coming from heaven: Thus <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. It is ſaid, <hi>that our life is hid with Chriſt in God:</hi> So that the Believer is affected with nothing, feeds upon, and is ſatisfied with nothing ſo much as he is with that which comes from heaven: He awakes, he ſleeps, he reſts there: This is to live in Heaven, and to be heavenly in our Converſation: And this is it that ye are called and oblidged to: even to have your converſation in heaven in all theſe forementioned reſpects: that as ye believers are of another nature, ſo ye may be of another and more divine Frame of ſoul in your work and walk, in your thoughts and words, in your outward duties, and in the exerciſe of inward Graces, in your commerce and trading, in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, delight, and ſatisfaction, to be heavenly in all.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall here <hi>ſay,</hi> This is a very hard task: <hi>I Anſwer firſt,</hi> Can it be hard to be in heaven? Nay, it's an eaſe rather, for Chriſt's <hi>yoke is eaſie and his burden is light:</hi> &amp; in as much as our Converſation is in heaven we have ſo much true Spiritual eaſe &amp; repoſe of ſoul: &amp; it is what we leave behind in the world, that makes the difficulty to get our Spirits ſcrued up to heaven, and to be kept there: here lyes the difficulty: but the more the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179825:71"/> heart and the mind be there, we have really the more eaſe. 2. Will ye ſhift, deny or decline the duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's difficult and hard? As indeed it is to corrupt nature: Notwithſtanding all the difficulty of it, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> with his fellows and followers did win to it in a good meaſure, and we may attain it through Grace, according to our Meaſure; Is not this the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which our Lord calleth <hi>Strait,</hi> and which but <hi>few find?</hi> And yet, if ye would try and make proof of it in good earneſt: ye would find it to be not ſo very ſtrait or unpaſſable as ye Imagine it to be: It would be found to be waited with ſuch delight, as would much ſweeten any hardneſs in it: and ye would not want an inſight in thoſe heavenly myſteries, and the beholding your names written in heaven and in the Lambs book of life, nor one hours feeding upon and being ſolaced by them, for all he delights of the men of this world: and ſince it's only hard to corruption, it ſhould be ſo much the more endeavoured and plyed hard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Uſe</hi> ſerves for <hi>Tryall,</hi> that we may know who is a Chriſtian indeed and a Thriving Chriſtian; or it may ſerve rather to be an uſe of <hi>Diſcovery</hi> and of <hi>Conviction;</hi> and indeed it may very eaſily and quickly make diſcovery of the unſoundneſs of many, and of the ſhort-coming of all: Need we inſiſt on this? Is it not a truth obvious to all, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſtians are called and oblidged to be heavenly in their Converſation? Are not theſe the Characters of ſuch a Converſation? Nay is there not yet much more requiſit in a Chriſtian, even a divineneſs above what we can expreſs? And if ye be (as ye may be) convinced that this is a truth; then let me in the next place <hi>ask</hi> you, if your Converſation be ſuch? Put your own conſciences to it; enquire at them whether your trade be to Heaven, whether your peace
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:179825:71"/> and joy, your delight and ſatisfaction be there? Would God ye would eſſay it, and could upon good ground ſay, that it is ſo: But Ah! is there any that can ſay it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome heſitation? Is not the beſt exceeding defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive? Or if many of you ſhall ſay, it is ſo; What then means your carnalneſs, your prevailing luſt, diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humours and paſſions? What means your ſo much pleading for ſelf-intereſts, this turning (as it were) of the World up-ſide down for our own particulars? How comes it to paſs, that ye who are profane do ſpend ſo much of your precious time in Tipling, and trifle away ſo much of it unprofitably many other wayes? Dare ye ſay, that ye who walk thus, are indeed followers of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul?</hi> Or if ye dare not ſay, that ye are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him in his Heavenly Converſation; can ye think or expect to dwel with him in Heaven? O! be not deceived, for God will not be mocked: when ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect ſeriouſly on your ſelves and on your way, will ye not find juſt ground for being aſhamed and confounded before God? or is there any of us all, that needs to want an errand to the Throne of Grace, to confeſs and crave Pardon for our ſinfull ſhort-coming in this? I ſhall only ſpeak a word or two in further proſecution of this <hi>Uſe,</hi> to you that are <hi>Stout-hearted</hi> and know no changes, that have alwayes a good opinion and a good word to ſay of your ſelves, Who are ready to ſay, that ye have a good meaning, and to think and ſay that ye loved God all your dayes; and who at beſt content your ſelves with and ſit down on a form of Religion, who never ſtudied to die to the world, and never made it your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in good earneſt, to Mortifie your luſts, and to be holy in the inward frame of your ſouls: Is this, think ye, to have your <hi>Converſation in Heaven?</hi> Would ye know then, if ever ye have ſtudied Chriſtianity ſeriouſly;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:179825:72"/> try it by this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether ye have been heavenly in your converſation; for however ye Judge of your ſelves, God will moſt certainly Judge you according to this Rule and qualification of a Chriſtian: It is both ſad and ſtrange to think, how it comes to paſs, that many of you bear and bolſter up your ſelves with a hope of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and profeſs that ye have no doubt but you ſhall come thither, who yet want and are void of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>I know ſuch will be ready to <hi>Object,</hi> Who are they that come this length? To which I ſhall only <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That, as I would be very loth to <hi>quench any ſmoking flax, or to break any bruiſed reed</hi> (whereof our Lord and Maſter is very tender) or to caſt water of diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement upon any the leaſt ſpark or ſpunk of ſincerity, where there is any honeſt aiming to walk according to this Rule; So, I cannot, I dare not but ſay to others, in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place; have ye walked under the conviction of this as a duty incumbent on you? and have ye ſeriouſly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to your ſelves as your great buſineſs in the World, to be ſincerely aiming at, and endeavouring after this Converſation in Heaven? or have ye not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had peace (ſuch as it was) when ye ſaid your prayers morning and evening, though ye did not ſo much as deſigne or aime at this throughout the day? And can ye with any ſhadow of reaſon think, ye have attained it or can attain it, who never ſeriouſly propoſed this as a Rule to your ſelves to walk by, nor never had a Conſcience-diſquieting challenge for ſuch neglect and manifeſt ſhort-coming? 2. What Labour are ye at, what pains take ye to proſecute ſuch a deſigne and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed project as this? It's one thing to pray, to be about external duties of Religion, and to be a <hi>Chriſtian in the letter;</hi> and another thing to be in theſe duties after a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:179825:72"/> heavenly manner, and to be a Chriſtian indeed, a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian inwardly and in the ſpirit, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God;</hi> Is it really your honeſt aime, deſigne and endeavour (whatever be the attainment) to be as much Heavenly in your converſation, as it is to be civil and formal, or to attend the outward Ordinances? I fear many of you cannot ſay, it is. 3. What weight lyes on your ſpirits, for your ſhort coming in this? Ye will (be like) ſay, we are all ſhort; which is a ſad truth, for indeed ſo we are; but are ye really weighted and grieved for your ſhort-coming in this? Have there been any times taken, to deal purpoſely with the Lord to remove the earthly mind, and to help to Heavenly-mindedneſs? Have there been challenges and any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſerious heart-exerciſe, becauſe of the want of a heavenly mind? and that not only ſometimes at the hearing of a Sermon, or in time of ſickneſs, or when under ſome other trouble; but in your more conſtant and habituall walk? Is it one of the great things for which ye blame and find fault with your ſelves before God? And though your outſide and viſible Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be blameleſs: yet while you look on the carnalneſs and earthlineſs of your mind, and on the want of this Divine and heavenly frame of ſoul, it makes you hang the head, marres your boldneſs, and (as it were) layes your feathers: becauſe, do what ye can, your heart will not abide in heaven: If it be thus, It's a token for good, and ſome ground of peace: but O! How rare is this? many of you, be like, have often overly prayed, <hi>Forgive us our ſins;</hi> who never took with, nor prayed for the Pardon of this ſin: but have lyen down at night and riſen up in the morning, having your hearts plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pudled in the world, without once minding hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in earneſt, and yet have never been challenged for it: Q ſad ſtate!</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:179825:73"/>
            <p>The <hi>Third Uſe</hi> Serves to <hi>Reprove</hi> and <hi>Expoſtulat</hi> for this unworthy carriage; for having either nothing at all, or but very litle of a Converſation in Heaven: We take it for granted, that many of us are far from it, and that all of us are litle in it; but very few even of the beſt are dayly and conſtantly Converſing in Heaven; Alace! it's but now and then with many ſad interruptions. For quickning this reproof and expoſtulation a litle, let me propoſe theſe few <hi>Queries</hi> to you; and in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, do ye not know that the neglect of this is a ſin and the breach of a Command; <hi>Be ye followers of me?</hi> 2. Is not this an excellent duty and royall priviledge, to be admitted to converſe in Heaven? And therefore the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it muſt not only be a ſin, but a great ſin, even a trampling on the Grace of God, a ſlighting of heaven and of a moſt noble priviledge and dignity. 3. Think ye Heaven to be of great worth; if ſo, muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing in heaven be of much worth? Will ye never ſo much as once go to ſee the houſe, wherein ye ſay ye are to dwel? Q! How unſuitable a thing is it, that thoſe who are but <hi>dayes men</hi> here, ſhould ſit down and ſettle on the earth without minding Heaven, and be ſo confined within time, as not ſeriouſly to mind eternity? 4. How can ye come before God with confidence and boldneſs, who do not endeavour thus to walk with him? Can ye ſay with Holy boldneſs; <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> Whoſe Converſation is not Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly? Can ye pray for Holineſs, and ſay theſe words, <hi>Thy will be done on Earth, as it is done in Heaven,</hi> who never ſtudied to be heavenly in any duty, that ye put hand to? But 5. And above all, I would ask you, can ye hope to die comfortably, nay can ye hope to die in ſafety, as to your ſouls, who know not heaven, nor what is there, nor what is the way to it? It gives a man
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179825:73"/> confidence and comfort at death, that he hath converſed in heaven in his life-time; ſuch a man hath but litle to do, when he comes to die, he knows the way and is not afraid, he knows the company and longs to be with them; he knows the privileges and longs for the full enjoyment of them; he hath litle here, his Treaſure is above in heaven, and his heart, Faith, Love, and hope are there; his Anchor is caſt within the vail, and he would fain be aſhore: ſure this is the Believers both duty and priviledge; do not think, that it is only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for from ſome More then ordinary Chriſtians, and who have nothing elſe to do: the matter is not ſo, it's moſt certainly a duty, to which ye are all called that have a mind to land fairly in heaven, when ye come off the troubleſome toſſing and tempeſtuous Sea of this world.</p>
            <p>Now Therefore in the <hi>Laſt</hi> room (as the <hi>Fourth Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi>) I <hi>Exhort, beſeech</hi> and <hi>Obteſt,</hi> in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, all of you that lay any claim to the hope of heaven, that ye would, and more then ever, ſtudy to have your Converſation in heaven; Q! Be followers of <hi>Paul</hi> and of his fellows in this thing: Need we adduce any motives to preſs this? Is not the duty clear? And is it not a moſt excellent duty, a moſt deſireable qualification of a Chriſtian walk? Is not heaven Tranſcendently excellent? And is it not excellent to be heavenly minded, and converſant in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Wherein may we expect to prevail with you, if not in bringing you to heaven? what is the thing that ſhould ſweeten the ſtudy of holineſs to you? Is it not this, even, that by having your converſation in heaven; ye come thither? Thoſe who are now in heaven think it a great motive, and if it be not a motive to you, ye will one day curſe your ſelves that ye Neglected it:
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179825:74"/> ſtudie it therefore in due time: This is the way to be free of the encombrances of an evil World: there is no hazard of this eſtate its being forfeited or ſequeſtred, there are no Plunderings nor quarterings here, no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty nor pain, nor any ſad evil occurrent here; Q! what a deſirable life is it to be above all thoſe things? And indeed in ſo far as your Converſation is heavenly in ſo far ye are above them, and live the life of Angels.</p>
            <p>It's like ye will <hi>Ask,</hi> what are the means or ſteps by which, we may win in and aſcend to this heavenlineſs of Converſation? which is indeed a very ſuitable and neceſſary queſtion, and would God we were ſerious in propoſing of it, and were convinced of the neceſſity of it: However, let ſuch as would fain be at it, know, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they muſt be much mortified, and denyed to Creature-Comforts: therefore <hi>Col.</hi> 3. Theſe two are oppoſed, <hi>Seek thoſe things which are above, ſet your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on things in heaven; and not on things of the earth:</hi> to go both up and down at once is impoſſible: if ye would be heavenly in your Converſation, ſeek to have the world litle and low in your eſtimation: to be not only free from the ſinfull intanglements of it, but to be Mortified to things lawfull: I preſs you not to negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in your honeſt and lawfull callings, far leſs to lay them aſide, but to a heavenly mindedneſs and holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyedneſs in your diligence: <hi>Uſe the things of this world as not abuſing them:</hi> as not being taken with them, nor glued to them: the minding of earthly things too much clogs and keeps mens hearts, that they do not mount up to heaven: It's impoſſible, while the heart is ſurfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares of this life, that it can thus ſore aloft. And therefore, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that would be heavenly in their converſation muſt lay up their treaſure in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179825:74"/> heaven, <hi>For where the Treaſure is, there will the heart be alſo:</hi> were ye under the deep and due conviction of the vanity of earthly things, and of the excellencie of heaven and heavenly things, and laying your reckoning ſoberly and ſeriouſly, that heaven ye muſt have, it would be much more eaſie to Scrue up your affections to it: as where mens ſtock and treaſure is, there is their heart: even ſo, were your great ſtock and treaſure in heaven, your heart would certainly be there: your hope, your love and delight would be there: But your ſeeking after contentment and ſatisfaction in earthly vanities, where it cannot be found, keeps your heart out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be much in the duty of meditation and contemplation of heavenly things: this is, (as it were) the great wheel and firſt mover of the Clock, to have the mind heavenly, often converſing in heaven, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thinking of it, and often recounting the bleſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, the glorious and great happineſs that are there, even till <hi>your meditation of God be made ſweet,</hi> and till your delight in him, thereby ſtirred up and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, make a heavenly converſation: for litle ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation makes litle heavenly-mindedneſs; and when the mind is not on heaven, ſomething that's worſe comes in the place of it; ye that know the bent and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own minds to be naturally downward, and how natively (to ſpeak ſo) it runs on vanities; and how difficult it is to keep it, but alongſt two or three ſentences, fixed on heavenly things: and how preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural a motion it is, (as it were) to make it aſcend and mount upward, will eaſily aſſent to the truth of this; It is an excellent word that <hi>David</hi> hath <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. <hi>When I awake I am ſtill with thee. Fourthly,</hi> We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this to you (hinted at before) that ye would be much in trading and Trafficking with Heaven; to be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:179825:75"/> often and ſerious in Prayer, frequently ſending up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires thither, and bringing thence returns of prayer in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Let thy will be done on earth, as it is done in Heaven;</hi> A word often in the mouths of many, but litle in their hearts: And Q! how lamentably unlike are the practiſes of many of you to it? We may indeed bluſh and think ſhame to ſpeak, and you may think ſhame to hear of having a Converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there being ſo litle of it amongſt us; But we muſt ſpeak of it and ye muſt hear it ſpoken of: ſince it is a part and a great part of our duty, and will be a part, and a great part of our reckoning: and we lay and leave it upon you from the Lord, to be ſtudied by you: Do not think that ye ſhall ever have your Converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven afterward, who have not your Converſation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here; many of you that have a fair Profeſſion of Religion, and ſeem to come near to that harbour of reſt and yet never enter into it, are like to a ſhip that comes, as it were, with up-ſails, very near the Port, and is unexpectedly blowen back to the Sea again; whereas the Believer who has his Anchor caſt on firm

            <p>IT is hard to conceive or expreſs, whether the things which the Goſpel offereth be the moſt large, or the terms on which they are offered be the moſt free. There is that, no doubt, in both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which may make the beholder ſtay and wonder. Among many excellent offers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that which is here is one very full and free: would to God we could look on it ſuitably. But Alace! we may fear, that we ſhall rather leave theſe ſweet words with a vail caſt over the Beauty, Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Luſtre of them, then lay them forth and unfold them as we ought, and as they call for; we would therefore look to himſelf whoſe words they are, and beſeech him to explain and make them out to us.</p>
            <p>That this Text ſpeaks of the Goſpel, of the times of the Goſpel, and of Goſpel-mercies, we take for granted and have good reaſon to do ſo, as on other accounts, ſo from <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. Which clearly holds out to us that theſe Promiſes are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of Temporal things: the <hi>fifth verſ.</hi> with all telling us, that the offer of this Grace Promiſed ſhall be made to the <hi>Nations.</hi>

            <p>We may take up the Words in theſe <hi>Four:</hi> or there is here a Goſpel-cryed fair or Market ſet out in <hi>Four</hi> things: <hi>Firſt</hi> in the Wares, <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Milk, that which Satisfies</hi> and <hi>is good</hi> and <hi>fatneſs verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Soul, life,</hi> and <hi>the ſure mercies of David, verſ.</hi> 3. Theſe are the Wares, which do all come to the ſame amount: if ye would know what that is: ye may conſider <hi>David two</hi> wayes, one is properly and perſonally, as he is the Son of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> and King of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> It's the Covenant which was made with him, a main Article whereof was, <hi>that out of his loine the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſhould one ſpring, who should ſit upon his Throne for ever:</hi> and thus <hi>the ſure mercies of David,</hi> are Chriſt and his benefits: The other way that ye would look on <hi>David</hi> is, as he was a Type of Chriſt the Anti-type &amp; Principal Covenanter or confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Party with God: and ſo in effect it turns to the ſame thing: only this latter way is more clear: So then we look on <hi>David</hi> here: as it is not unuſuall for the Scriptures to hold him forth, <hi>viz.</hi> As a Type of Jeſus Chriſt; and indeed the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing do abundantly clear it: for <hi>David</hi> Perſonally conſidered was now long ſince dead and gone, and was not <hi>the witneſs</hi> nor <hi>the leader of the people:</hi> Therefore it muſt needs be Jeſus Chriſt that here is meant, mainly and Principally at leaſt: As is very clear <hi>Acts</hi> 13.34. Chriſt then being looked on as here underſtood, <hi>The ſure mercies of David,</hi> are the ſure Mercies Covenanted and bargained (to ſpeak ſo) to Chriſt before the World was: and it plainly implies, that there was a Covenant or bargain
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:179825:77"/> betwixt the Father and the Son about the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the World, whereof as to the benefits therein Covenanted to the Mediator, the Goſpel maketh an aſſignation to Believers in time. 2. We have the Chap-man (to ſay ſo) or the Merchant to whom the wares are offered: It is he that <hi>thriſts,</hi> he that wants and would have: and if any ſerious Poor ſouls ſhould think, that they are not ſuitably ſenſible of their wants: then, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Let him that hath no money come,</hi> that is, plain dyvours (as we ſpeak) or bankrupts that have nothing. 3. We have the terms on which all are offered to ſale, and they indeed ſuit won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly well with the Merchant: <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Buy without Money and without price, Hear and your Soul shal live, and I will make an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with you:</hi> There is (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) not a Purſe opened in, nor a penny payed for the Aſſignation of this bargain: though by Chriſt's ſatisfaction there was a very great, a very coſtly and dear price payed: when Chriſt came to buy and make a purchaſe of all theſe Mercies for the Elect, the Market was very high and the prices were up: but when Believers come, by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to receive them, the Market is come down, and the prices are fallen wonderfully low: that which ſtood him very dear is to be had by them <hi>Gratis</hi> very freely, even for nothing: It's good that Chriſt was at the Market before us, He hath cheapened the Prices admirably: &amp; leſt any ſhould think, that though there be no Merit, yet ſomething
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:179825:77"/> muſt be to Mollifie the ſeller, and to commend the Merchant to him: It's ſaid, <hi>Let him come without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and without price,</hi> without money or money-worth, he that hath no commending qualification is bid come. 4. We have the Proclamation of this Market, as Grace hath choice wares and ſets them out very freely to ſale, ſo it keeps them not cloſe ſhut up; but brings them forth to publick view: and to every one, <hi>Ho Come to the waters,</hi> it inviteth all to Come (as it were) to the ſhore, as if ſome fleet were come in with rare and rich Commodities, for which men were to pay nothing: the Proclamation is, <hi>Come and buy without Money:</hi> and becauſe Grace will not eaſily take a nay ſay, there is O <hi>Ho,</hi> an <hi>Oyes</hi> Prefixed, <hi>Ho come and buy:</hi> But becauſe there is dulneſs and ſlowneſs on our part. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, there is an expoſtulation added, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Wherefore ſpend ye your money for that which is not Bread, and your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> The Aſſignation of the Bargain and the offer of the wares, are again urged, <hi>Come, and I will make an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with you:</hi> And to let us know that this is ſure, He ſubjoines, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>I have given him for a witneſs and leader to the people:</hi> That all who are ſenſible of their own inability to come, may be heartned to it in hope of his help to enable them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall only in ſhort, <hi>Obſerve</hi> theſe <hi>Two Points</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> From the words. The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is, that, <hi>There is a moſt gracious and mercifull transaction betwixt the Father and the Son for the good and Salvation of poor Souls, even of all the elect, paſt before the World was.</hi> The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:179825:78"/> bankrupt ſinners upon exceeding eaſy, low and condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt doctrine</hi> is implyed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption, wherein there were ſo many given to Chriſt, whoſe Price he undertook to pay, is ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day:</hi> So that, what is laid on the Son, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39 As the condition of this Covenant, is in the 40 <hi>verſ.</hi> made offer of to Believers by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Doctrine</hi> hath <hi>two</hi> branches; The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, <hi>That there was a tranſaction concerning the Salvation of loſt Sinners, betwixt the Father and the Son before the World was?</hi> A Covenant made with <hi>David,</hi> before it is or can be declared and Preached in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the terms whereof were reſolved on, and all the Articles of it agreed upon; The Father propoſing, and the Son accepting the bargain from eternity; as is clear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6, 7. Where, when it is, as it were, conſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed what ſhall be the Price of Redemption, It is not <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices nor burnt Offerings;</hi> but <hi>a bodie haſt thou Prepared me; Behold! come, in the Volume of thy book it is written of me, I delight to do thy will, O my God;</hi> Which is expreſly applyed to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 7. This is eaſily cleared from the conſideration of the parties contracting, and of the ends for which this Covenant was undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and of the effects that follow upon it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Branch of the Doctrine is, that <hi>this as to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:179825:78"/> ſinners is a moſt gracious and mercifull, a moſt kind, lowing and lovely tranſaction, exceedingly for the behove and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Sinners.</hi> There are <hi>Four</hi> words in the <hi>Text,</hi> Which hold out this; 1. The Nature of this Covenant is <hi>Mercy,</hi> all the Articles of it Savour ſtrong of Mercy to ſinners; They are exempted, though Chriſt came under ſore ſtrokes: whether we conſider this Covenant as exacting of Chriſt; or promiſing to Chriſt, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for ſinners behove. 2. It is a Covenant of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> of many various mercies, So, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. It is ſaid to be <hi>an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things and ſure;</hi> and, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. It is ſaid, <hi>according as his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power hath given unto us all things, that pertain to life and Godlineſs:</hi> Mercies of Juſtification, Pardon of ſin, Sanctification in all its graduall advances, of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God, of grace and Glory, even of every good thing or good things of all ſorts. 3. It's very gracious and mercifull in reſpect of the excellent kind of theſe Mercies, they are not common mercies, <hi>but mercies of David,</hi> beſtowed upon his anointed; Chriſt is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and filled with them, <hi>That out of his fulneſs we may receive and grace for grace:</hi> even grace in a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. 4. They are ſtable mercies, not fleeting and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone; not a glance of Mercy which evaniſheth, the Covenant is everlaſting, and the mercies are <hi>the ſure mercies of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we might Particularly go through all the parts of this Covenant, Mercie will be found ſweetly looking out in everie article, clauſe and Circumſtance of it. Look firſt; more generally to the <hi>whole</hi> of it; it's all loving kindneſſes and mercies to ſinners; Look to Chriſts Sufferings and Death, O! what mercy ſhines conſpicuouſly there? To his qualifications for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all his Offices; to his anointing with the ſpirit
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179825:79"/> without meaſure; There is great mercie there; to all the Promiſes made to him, ſuch as theſe, <hi>He shal ſee his ſeed; the Pleaſure of the Lord shall proſper in his hand; by his knowledge shall he Juſtifie many; He shall have a willing People,</hi> Eternally to reign with him, &amp;c. Are not theſe loud ſpeaking Mercies? The grace and wiſdome that is on the Fathers ſide, and the grace and love that is on the Sons ſide, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e all for the behove and good of ſinners; It's all wonderfully behovefull; is it not great Mercy to you believers, that you were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this bargain? The Lord Chriſt, as God, neither needed nor was capable of any acceſſion of Grace; he took the relation of our Redeemer and Mediator, and as ſuch in the humane nature, was filled with Grace and Bowels of Mercy and Compaſſion, that Grace and Mercy might look through that relation to us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> And more particularly, look to the <hi>riſe</hi> of it; It bred in Gods own boſome (to ſpeak ſo) <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that He gave his only Begotten Son, that whoſoever should believe on Him, might not perish, but have Eternal life;</hi> and the Son laid down His life out of pure love; there was no neceſſity on him to do ſo, but what he voluntarily came under; there was no Motive from us to it, nor had he any adviſer to it. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Look to the manner of his undertaking; It was very readily, Chearfully, and with ardent, vehemently ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love; So that we may ſay of it as of that Chariot mentioned, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.10. <hi>It is made of, and Paved with Love, for the Daughters of Jeruſalem;</hi> The Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the curſe, Chriſt out of meer love undertakes to ſatisfie Juſtice for them; <hi>Sacrifices</hi> will not do it, <hi>rivers of Oyle</hi> will not do it, The <hi>firſt born of the body</hi> will not do it, nor ſatisfie for the <hi>ſin of the Soul;</hi> What will do it then? Grace ſuggeſts, that the Son ſhall become
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179825:79"/> man, and do it, and the Son ſaith, <hi>Lo I come;</hi> O! What love and mercy are here? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Look to the <hi>Contrivance</hi> of it; and there ye will find much Grace and Mercy; that it is made with a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and with a mediator that is a <hi>Surety,</hi> that the ſtock is beſtowed on him and put under his Cuſtodie, that the Promiſes are made to him and the Price exacted from himſelf. 5ly, Look to the Manner of executing it; what love, Grace and mercy ſhines forth in the Father, in taking vengeance on his only begotten Son for us? What love in the Son, in yeelding to take it on, and in his leaving his manifeſtative Glory for a time, that he might undergo the curſe, and in his doing all this with delight? <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Look to the confirmations of this Covenant; the Oath of God on the Fathers ſide, the death of the Mediator on the Sons ſide; and he hath freely bequeathed it, as a confirmed Teſtament and legacy to us Believers, and hath inſtituted Sacraments to be Seals thereof; O! What mercy upon mercy! <hi>Seventhly.</hi> Conſider the effects of it; it runs in the ſweet ſtreams of Grace, into the vaſt Gulfe and Ocean of Glory; Wonderfull mercy? <hi>Eightly,</hi> Look to the Parties Confederating and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting; the Father, Son, and Spirit, all are here, And, it's Grace and mercy that they Covenant, 2. Who are the Contrivers of it? Are not even they in their deep wiſdom, and in their exuberant, Superabundant and infinit Grace and mercy? 3. What is the end of it? <hi>Even ehe Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, Eph.</hi> 1.5. Grace bringing forth and manifeſtly ſhewing here it's great maſter-peece. 4. As infinit wiſdom and love contrive, ſo infinit Power executs it: and when all theſe concurre in this bargain: when the infinitly wiſe God, all the Perſons of the moſt Glorious Dreadful and Adorable Trinity (as it were) ſet themſelves to ſet
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179825:80"/> forth the Glory of free Grace, to make Angels and Saints Behold and Admire in it infinit Wiſdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible love, what a rare piece muſt it needs be? And this is the end of it, as is clear: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3 9. <hi>That all men might ſee what is the fellowship of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: which from the beginning of the World, hath been hid in God, who Created all things by Jeſus Chriſt, to the intent, that now unto the Principalities and powers in the Heavenly places, might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Doctrine</hi> is, That <hi>this good and gracious bargain, that's paſt betwixt the Father and the Son, which is wholly mercie, is brought to the Market and expoſed to ſale, on exceeding eaſie and condeſcending termes, and that to bankrupt ſinners:</hi> What Proclaims the Lord here? even this; I will give you the <hi>Sure mercies of David:</hi> That which I and my Son have carved out for the glory of Grace, and for a proof of the riches of my bounty, I will make all over to you freely. Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. It's called, <hi>the unſearchable riches of Chriſt;</hi> So that, whatever Chriſt hath as Mediator, It is holden forth here; <hi>That out of his fulneſs we may receive Grace for Grace,</hi> a Proportion of all the Grace that is in him.</p>
            <p>In Proſecuting this point, we ſhall ſhew, 1. More Particularly what this bargain is, that is put to the ſale. 2. Who the Merchant is. 3. What are the termes on which, and how it is made. 4. What is the manner how the Goſpel puts home this bargain, and layes Chriſt and his fulneſs forth upon <hi>Stands</hi> in the Market-place, as it were, (to ſpeak thus with reverence of this Divine Myſtery) that there may be free acceſs, to whoſoever will come, and buy theſe rare and rich Wares and Commodities.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> that ye may know what the <hi>Bargain</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:179825:80"/> is, and what is in your offer in this day of the Goſpel, Take it in theſe few Particulars; 1. All that ever any Believer in the world had, is put to ſale here; if any Believer ever had fair Priviledges, ſure it was <hi>David;</hi> if any ever had a mercifull bargain, he had it; and ſuch is this Covenant; Juſtification, Adoption, peace with God, Grace and Glory; all theſe Marrowie, Materiall, maſſie and eſſentiall bleſſings that <hi>David</hi> had, it was not another Chriſt, nor another Heaven, nor Another Covenant of Grace that he had, but the ſame that's here. 2. Conſider it further, and we will find it to be, all that is made over to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; If he had a good bargain, the ſpirit without meaſure, fulneſs of truth and Grace, great Glory and Honour, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the right hand of the Father, the ſame is Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers their bargain proportionably, a due and juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion being kept betwixt the head and the members, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received and Grace for Grace:</hi> It's not another but the ſame Grace that our Lord Jeſus hath; yea it's not another Glory they are advanced to; no other Table they are ſet down to; no other Throne they are ſet on; but the ſame Glory, Table, and Throne. It's to <hi>Behold his Glory,</hi> to <hi>Sit at his Table, To ſit with him on his Throne: John</hi> 17.22.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. In a word there are not two Covenants of Redemption betwixt Jehovah and the Mediator, one for himſelf and another for the elect: but it's one and the ſame Covenant for both, though with many vaſtly different reſpective conſiderations and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. 3. Look to the Wares and Commodities (to ſpeak ſo) that are expoſed to ſale in the Goſpel: they are not only the Promiſes made to Chriſt, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is brought forth to the Market, <hi>He</hi> is the great Promiſe, and far beyond all the other promiſes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179825:81"/> made in, and the Graces given by the Covenant: I <hi>have given Him</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 4.) <hi>For a witneſs and leader to the People: He</hi> is the great gift of God, <hi>that</hi> Gift of Gifts, being <hi>the Fathers fellow:</hi> Nothing in Heaven or Earth, no Perſon, man, or Angel can by far, very far, infinitly far, equall him: to whom can you liken or compare him? <hi>To us</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah Chap.</hi> 9.) <hi>A Child is born, to us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his shoulders, and his Name shall be called wonderful Counſeller, the mighty God, the Everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace:</hi> this is <hi>David,</hi> moſt ſubſtantial Maſſie mercy: He is called <hi>Wonderful,</hi> becauſe there is no Poſſibility for Creatures adequatly to conceive, or with exact ſuitableneſs to expreſs what his Name is, or what is comprehended within his Name. 4. Look on Chriſt as Mediator, as God-man, <hi>Immanuel God with us:</hi> There is put to the Market (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) God himſelf: for thus the Covenant is expounded and Sum'd, as frequently elſewhere in the Scripture, ſo particularly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will be their God:</hi> and <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.17. <hi>He that overcometh shal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit all things, and I will be his God.</hi> Now conſider all theſe in a Conjunction: <hi>viz.</hi> What all believers have: what Chriſt hath, and Chriſt himſelf; what God hath, and God himſelf: O! what an incomprehenſibly rich and rare, great and Glorious bargain is this! and yet all is by the Goſpel brought forth, laid before the hearers of it, and made offer of to them, on moſt eaſie and wonderfully condeſcending terms. May we briefly and in a few words ſum up what is in it? 1. All things that may make up believers their Peace with God, and remove the quarrel. 2. All things pertaining to, or needful for life and godlineſs, as it is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. 3. All things that belong to the comfort and conſolation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:179825:81"/> of Believers, even <hi>ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> as it is called <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. There is no want ſo great, but there is a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie for it here, no caſe ſo ſad, but there is a comfort for it here; there is not any thing that looks like a crack or uncertainty, but there is ſufficient ſecurity for it here, in this Covenant, (in this moſt full and wonderfully <hi>well ordered Covenant in all things and very ſure</hi>) to all who are fled to Chriſt for refuge. 4. There is in it what is needful and requiſit to full ſatisfaction, to the Solace, delight, joy and compleat happineſs of the perſons that cordially cloſe with it: So that a Soul can crave no more, nor wiſh for more; It is even <hi>all their deſire, as David</hi> ſaith of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. It's <hi>Menſura voti,</hi> nay <hi>ultra menſuram voti;</hi> it never entred into mans heart to conceive much leſs to deſire it. It makes the Soul ſay, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? There is none on earth, whom I deſire beſides thee:</hi> It hath <hi>all things</hi> in it: as it is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7. <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things:</hi> For if God and Chriſt, Grace and mercy be in it, is there any thing a miſſing? or can there poſſibly be any thing wanting in it? May I not very confidently ask you; Is it not a good bargain? If the Father Son and Holy Spirit, Grace, Heaven and Glory be a good bargain; this is then moſt certainly a good bargain, a wonderfully good, matchleſs, and non-ſuch bargain: and is not this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, whereby all theſe great things are brought to the market, good news? Take heed then that ye receive not this Grace in vain, that theſe wares worthy of all poſſible intertainment and welcome ſtand not before you unbought: I ſay again take heed, that ye receive not all this Grace in vain, that theſe Precious and coſtly wares go not from the Market unbought up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who are the Chap-men or Merchants? You
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:179825:82"/> would have readily thought that ſuch wares would have required mighty Monarchs, great States-men, learned Philoſophers, or holy Kings, Prophets, Apoſtles and great men; And yet the Proclamation is (for grace cometh ordinarily in the lower way) <hi>Ho, every one that thirſts, and he that hath no money:</hi> theſe are the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants who are meet for this rich Ware: Are there any that want what may make them happy, and would fain have? Are there any that have their peace to make with God, any that have not their intereſt clear, and made ſure? any that are wreſtling with a bodie of death, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaning under it? Any that fain would have ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and ſubdued? Any that would have Grace, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory, and have nothing to give for all theſe or any of them, and who have ſpent many years labour in vain and to no purpoſe, to come by them? It's to you, even to you that all theſe rich Wares and rare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are in a ſpeciall manner offered in this cryed Fair of free grace. And to clear this a litle, I ſuppoſe, there are none of you but you are ſome way under one of theſe <hi>Three,</hi> though the externall call and offer comes indifferently to you all. Ye are either, 1. Senſeleſs and ſecure; and to you the Goſpel ſays, <hi>How long ye fools will ye love ſimplicity? And how long will ye ſleep, O ſluggards?</hi> As there is a Challenge and regrate here, So there is a condition all offer made to you, in as far as it is here implyed, that the Offer is made to them. <hi>Who have no bread</hi> and have been <hi>beſtowing their labour on that which ſatisfies not:</hi> glutting themſelves with the world, or wrapping themſelves up in the groundleſs conceit of their own righteouſneſs; To ſuch it ſaith, <hi>How long will ye ſpend your labour for that which is not bread:</hi> Or, 2. Ye are ſome way affected with ſin, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Convictions, ſtinged, ſome way burnt up, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:179825:82"/> conſumed with the apprehenſions of the wrath and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of God; The word which this Offer hath to ſuch is, the very firſt in the Proclamation, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſts, Come:</hi> and as we expoſtulated with the <hi>firſt ſort, viz</hi> ſenſeleſs ſecure unconcerned, proud and con eity ſtanders aloof, ſo we bid you earneſtly come: and if ye ſhall ſay, your conviction hath no edge with it, it is not deep enough: We <hi>Anſwer, let him that hath no money come:</hi> if ye have quite given over all Hope of your Prayers and other Performances, as to making your peace with God by them, and have in that reſpect utterly renounced your own righteouſneſs, and ſo, <hi>have no money, no price:</hi> though ye be not pinched and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the heart under the ſenſe of ſin and deſerved wrath, as ye would: yet come, O come. Or, 3. Ye are ſuch as have taken with your ſin and loſt ſtate, and are in ſome meaſure, though but faintly (at leaſt to your own apprehenſion) ſtirring towardſt Chriſt, and would fain be at him: up, for to you the offer moſt kindly ſayes; <hi>Hear and your ſouls shal live, eat and be ſatisfied.</hi> The wares are not brought forth and laid before you, that ye ſhould only (to ſay ſo) block or cheapen, and ask the price; but alſo and mainly, that ye ſhould buy, eat and feed on them; The Goſpel doth not, as it were, ſo much offer to make with you a bargain, as it offers you the benefit of a bargain already made, <hi>viz.</hi> With Chriſt: and thus theſe <hi>Three</hi> take in every perſon that wants, and is not, it may be, ſo ſenſible of it, and every one that wants and would have.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Third,</hi> viz. The <hi>Terms</hi> on which the cloſing of the bargain depends: they are holden forth in <hi>Four</hi> words in the <hi>Text,</hi> with <hi>Two</hi> qualifications: which make up the terms. The <hi>firſt Word</hi> is, <hi>Come;</hi> and that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:179825:83"/> ſuppoſeth peoples leaving of their preſent ſtanding-place and poſture, and their moving towards the Market-place, where the rich Ware is expoſed to ſale. The Second <hi>Word</hi> is, <hi>Buy;</hi> which imports a Price put on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-Ware, a valuing of it, and a ſort of treating to make it ours. The Third <hi>Word</hi> is, <hi>Hearken, incline the ear,</hi> to wit, to God, and to his word, to believe and receive it, <hi>and your ſouls shall live.</hi> And the Fourth <hi>Word</hi> is, <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an engagement by Covenant to the Lord, after hearing and inclining the ear to his word, a ſtriking of hands and cloſing with the bargain. Add to theſe the qualifications, <hi>viz.</hi> Coming, buying, ſtriking hands (as it were) and cloſing the bargain, and that without offering <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Price,</hi> Money or money-worth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering or giving any thing leſs or more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us ſee how the Goſpel puts all this to the Market; ſo that, where it comes, thoſe that are called muſt either cloſe the bargain, or it will be their own fault. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it Proclaimes the Fair (as it were) to all round about, that there are ſuch wares to be had, and at ſuch a Price, the rareſt and richeſt wares and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and at the cheapeſt rates that ever the world heard tell of. 2. It doth not only Proclaim, but invite and double the invitation to come. 3. It not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, but puts the invitation ſo home, that People muſt either make the price, (to ſay ſo, though it may be ſoon made, there being in effect no price) and buy, or refuſe the Bargain: If they will not be at the Paines to come in to the ſhop, as it were, It brings forth the wares and lays them down in the Market-place, and (as it were) on <hi>Stands</hi> in the ſtreet: and cryes, Come, buy, come and enter the Covenant freely: and this it
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:179825:83"/> doth by a frank offer, by earneſt and perſwaſive invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the eaſie Conditions that it propoſeth the bargain on: It ſtands in a manner with armes ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ready to receive all comers very freely, whatever their Poverty, wants and neceſſities be: It craves no more but that we willingly take what he offers to put in our hand: <hi>The righteouſneſs of Faith ſaith not, who shall aſcend to Heaven, or shall deſcend to the depth?</hi> there is nothing now to be ſuffered, nor to be Purchaſed by any more ſuffering: <hi>But the word is near thee in thy heart and in thy mouth:</hi> It layes the ware at our very door (as it were) So that we have no more to do, but to ſtoop down and take it up: but heartily to ſay the word, and it is a bargain.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Application:</hi> may we not reſume, and ſay, that there is a good and excellent bargain to be had in the Goſpel, and on very good and eaſie terms? It's a Market day, and indeed it were a pity that ſuch wares ſhould be brought to the Market, and that few or none ſhould buy: that Chriſt ſhould (to ſpeak ſo) open his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k and ſell no wares. Therefore let me ſay a few words to you for perſwading you readily and preſently to embrace the Offer of this richeſt Bargain. And in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, we pray you believe this truth: Alace! there is litle or no faith given to it: Souls come ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not throughly believing, that God is putting Chriſt, Grace and Glory, Heaven and Happineſs and all to Sale: Theſe are dayes of <hi>The Son of man,</hi> in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wherein Chriſts fleet (to ſpeak ſo with Reverence) is come home, the Shops are now well furniſhed with Rich Commodities, all his <hi>Stands</hi> are ſet out and full of Grace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wonder that God hath condeſcended to make offer of ſuch a bargain to us: that, that which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:179825:84"/> coſt Chriſt ſo very dear, is offered ſo exceeding cheap to us. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We exhort and obteſt you, that while theſe choiſeſt wares are ſet to ſale, ye receive not this offer in vain: Are there any Merchants here for ſuch wares? Here is the Market, the wares are good and ſufficient, and the terms very eaſie, and the Price won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly low, even ſo low, that it comes to no <hi>Money,</hi> no <hi>Price:</hi> can ye Poſſibly wiſh a better bargain or more eaſie terms? Are there any chap men that want <hi>Money,</hi> any that are <hi>Thirſty,</hi> then Come; yea be the frame and diſpoſition of your heart what it may be, if you would have it righted, come; there is here that which will make you Rich &amp; Happie here and hereafter: are there none of you that will ſeriouſly ask, what the Lord will ſay, what Chriſt will take (as it were) for theſe wares, or what are his terms; with a ſincere reſolution to take them on theſe very terms? Will ye not be Prevailed with to make experimental tryal, what it is to have Chriſt <hi>Made of God to you wiſdome, Righteouſneſs, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Redemption?</hi> Are there none among you all that have ſins to be pardoned, wants to be ſupplied, ſtrong and ſtirring Corruptions to be ſubdued and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified? Is it Poſſible that ſo many are come hither for the faſhion? Are there none living at diſtance from God, nor under his curſe really or to their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that would have the diſtance and curſe remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Are there no weak Graces to be ſtrengthened? If there be any ſuch merchants that have a mind and heart to the wares: I ſay to them from the Lord, as his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld: <hi>Ho every one that Thirſts, and he that hath no money come:</hi> This is the ſcope of the Goſpel, and the preparation for Chriſt, and alſo for the Communion, that it calleth for from poor Souls, that would fain cloſe the bargain, and ſet their Seal to it, and would have
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:179825:84"/> Gods Seal ſet to it to morrow by taking the Sacrament. Speak, what ſay ye? Poſe and put your hearts to it to declare, if they be indeed willing and well content to make and hold the bargain on his own terms; if they be ſo, (as there is all the reaſon in the world they ſhould;) then I ſay, ye have a good bargain: I ſay again ſpeak, poſe your hearts, if ye will make and hold the bargain on theſe terms or not.</p>
            <p>There are theſe things that do ſingularly commend this bargain. <hi>Firſt,</hi> the excellencie of it; ye will go through all the Markets in the World, ere ye get ſuch ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h Mercies, of ſo rare a kind, ſo ſure and ſo cheap; ye would, belike, think much to have ſo much land, gold or money; but what are thoſe to this bargain? Thoſe will evaniſh and turn to aſhes, when this will endure and abide with you for ever: What are ye doing? Who are like ſo many Horſe-leaches, ſucking up, and glutting your ſelves with the world, or living ſecurely and careleſly, or pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ching up your own righteouſneſs; is there any of thoſe bargains like this? we appeal to your own conſciences, and nothing doubt, but they will one day bear witneſs againſt you, that ye heard of ſuch a bargain and had it in your offer, and yet wilfully refuſed to accept of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is there any bargain more ſuitable for you, who have your peace to make with God; for you who have corruption lively in you, then to have a King, Captain and conqueror to bring it down and to trample on it, after he hath as a Prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled you to God? Is there any more ſuitable bargain for you, who have your own pinches and ſtraits, and your Comforts at a very low ebb, for you who have wants which cannot be numbred, and who cannot of your ſelves command one ſtayed ſpirituall thought? If ye were perfectly righteous and fairly landed in Eternity,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:179825:85"/> ye might poſſibly think the leſs of it (though even Glorified Saints put a great value on it, and glorious Angels admire it) but that ſinners dwelling on earth in cottages of clay, whoſe habitation is in the duſt, ſhould think litle of it, it's ſtrange and even ſtupendious: Is there or can there be a more ſuitable bargain for you that want money? Is it not exactly calculated for your caſe and ſhapen out for you; ſo as in every thing it may meet with your wants, difficulties and Objections? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Are not the terms moſt reaſonable? No great thing is ſought for from you; if a Lordſhip or a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were offered to a poor man for a Penny, that hath no money at all, it would ſignifie nothing at all to him; But behold here peace and Pardon, Grace and Glory, even all good things are offered to you freely. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is not your neceſſity ſuch, that ye cannot be well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? For tho ye ſhould ſpend your money, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow much labour, and even wear out your very eyes with weeping and your hearts with grief and ſorrow, if ye take not this courſe, all will only have this Moto written thereon, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity and vexation of ſpirit:</hi> when ye come to feed on it, ye will find it to be but wind: if peace with God, if God and Chriſt, if grace and Glory be neceſſary, then this bargain is neceſſary; but if ye will continue lazie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, Luk-warme and unconcerned in the matter; ye ſhall find that ye have ſitten in your own light great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuffered the opportunity of the Market to ſlip, which ye will never poſſibly recover: And therefore for the Lords ſake, let neither legall weeping, carnal fear or ſorrow, hypocriſie, ſelf-conceit, nor miſtakes of Chriſt and of free Grace divert you from making this bargain: but ſeek Grace, come over theſe and all other obſtructions, and while the Market laſts, <hi>Come and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:179825:85"/> buy without money and without Price.</hi> It is hard to know how long your day ſhall laſt: There are many Countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides and Cities, in the ſtreets whereof theſe Packs (to ſay ſo) of rich wares were opened up, Laid forth and expoſed to ſale, that now for many years, yea for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages have not heard of them, nor the Goſpel preached: what (at leaſt in Purity and Power) is now in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and in the ſeven famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> But the <hi>voice</hi> of Terrour, and as it were, the Scriching of Owls? and ſeeing God is not ſlack, as men count ſlackneſs, what know ye, when the Kingdom of God may be taken from you, and given to others? And when he will cry (to ſpeak ſo) Pack and go? Every day is not a Market day, every Lords day is not a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion day: many Congregations in <hi>Ireland</hi> and elſe where have ſadly found this, wherein it hath come to paſs, that great ſcarcity and want are come where there was once great plenty. And to preſs this a little further, We may in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place <hi>Ask,</hi> whereat it ſticks and halts? I tell you, that there either muſt be a bargain, or it muſt (and will ſometime) be known where the blame lyes: were it but the bare reading of theſe very words, they bring the invitation and offer to you, and will ye dare to caſt at the wares, or the terms on which they are offered? Grace brings a good bargain to you and ſtoops very low with it. For 1. It will not ſtand with you on bygones, if now you deal honeſtly, <hi>The ſure Mercies of David</hi> will cover and blot out thoſe: and if any of you think, that ye have much debt on your head, as who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h not? It will not upbraid you: <hi>the iniquity of Jacob shall be ſought for, and shall not be found.</hi> There ſhall be, as it were, Scores drawn through them, your accounts ſhall be all daſhed out by free graces Pen: This is a cryed Fair and Proclaimed Market of free
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:179825:86"/> grace, from which no honeſt comer ſhall be ſecluded, thruſt back or ſent away empty; for here an empty pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e needs not make a (blate o) baſhful Merchant. 2. Grace ſtands not preciſely on fore-prepa ations (whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Souls honeſtly and ſincerely come) as that ye have not been ſo and ſo humbled, and have not ſuch and ſuch previous qualifications, as ye would be at; Nay ſomeway it excludes theſe, as offering to bring money and ſome price, which would quite ſpoile the nature of the Market of free grace; nay yet me ſay further, if it were poſſible that a ſoul would come without ſenſe of ſin, Grace would embrace it: ſenſe of ſin being no condition of the Covenant, but a Phyſicall (to ſpeak ſo) qualification of the Covenanter, and grace is free to them that want it: and let it be ſuppoſed to be in a perſon void of Grace and ſtill in unrenewed black nature, it's there but a ſplendid ſin, as thoſe ſhadows of Morall vertues in all meerly natural men, are; Grace can, at the inſtant of coming, creat qualifications: there could readily be no qualifications in <hi>Zacheus</hi> when he was on the tree: Yet Chriſt tells him, <hi>Salvation this day is come to thy houſe.</hi> 3. Grace ſtands not on the want of any effect of Faith, where it calls to believing: it will not ſtand on dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of intereſt, nor on want of progreſs in Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor on things being out of order: for where it comes, it puts things in order; It will be no relevant exception for a perſon that hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cloſed with the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and hath not embraced Chriſt, to ſay, alace! I have no love to God, to the Godly and to his intereſt: becauſe Grace can ſay, thou haſt not cloſed with Chriſt, and ſo canſt not have the effect before the cauſe: come and cloſe, and theſe and other effects ſhall follow. 4. It ſtands not on degrees of Faith, nor on the ſtrength firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and height of it; it will take little, even a look, or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:179825:86"/> a glance of the ſouls eye that ſees not clearly, according to that memorable word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.5. <hi>They looked to him and were lightened:</hi> the more that ſouls look to Chriſt, their eye grows the clearer: it will take an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly willing mind and hearty conſent, though the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be very litle, a receiving or a ſincere minting at receiving of the offer: <hi>Him that comes,</hi> or is really a coming, though he be not yet come, at leaſt, as he thinks, but is, with the Prodigal, ſtill (as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends) afar off, <hi>Will Chriſt and Grace in no caſe caſt-out:</hi> for no ſooner doth ſpiritual life ſtir in Faiths weakeſt acting and moving towards Chriſt, but Grace meets it. 5. It ſtands on no concomitants, though there ſhould be many Idols and luſts raging in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if there be a reall conſenting by Faith to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with a ſincere reſolution to abandon all theſe, grace will not ſend him away empty: or if the man ſay, <hi>Lord I believe help my unbelief,</hi> that is a done bargain: nay, were it to come with many ſpiritual iſſues and ſores running, and with fear to preſume, and as it were, to ſteal a hint of Chriſt; not to ſpeak a word to him, but to touch him: He will not be angry nor upbraid, but will ſay, <hi>go in peace, thy Faith hath made the whole.</hi> We may Ask yet, further to the recommendation of Grace. 1. Was there ever a Merchant that came to the market with that purpoſe, to buy on its own terms, that went away empty and without wares? If all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt born were put to it, they would be ready to bear witneſs, that Grace never ſtood with them on any qualification in them, when they came honeſtly. 2. I Would <hi>Ask,</hi> was there ever any that adventured honeſtly on it, whom it miſ-gave? That hazarded (to ſpeak ſo) and yet fell by the way, or that ever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves that they hazarded and entruſted their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179825:87"/> Souls to this bargain? 3. Let me <hi>Ask,</hi> was there eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is a great vanity in the matter of ſin. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> If we look to the ſad effects, and bitter fruits of ſin; and to the great prejudice that comes by it; It will be found to be deſperat Madneſs and dear bought pleaſure, which is but fancied and Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and no reall Pleaſure: It marres the life of Grace &amp; of peace with God, <hi>and treaſures up Wrath againſt the day of Wrath;</hi> See this verified eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Ahithophel,</hi> that Prodigy of profound Policie (<hi>Whoſe counſel, in thoſe dayes, with</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Abſalom <hi>was, as, if one had enquired at the Oracle of God.</hi>) The upſhot of whoſe deep wit was rank follie, when he went and hanged himſelf: See it alſo convincingly made good, in the rich Man in the Goſpel, To whom it's ſadly and ſurpriſingly ſaid, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul shall be taken from thee, and whoſe then shall thoſe things be?</hi> And what advantage or wiſdom is it.

And their quiting the way of Life? Now the word of God is true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the way of life is therein clearly holden forth, and God as our pattern; and is there any thing more reaſonable, then that we ſhould live like, and be conform to the word of God, and to him of whom we ought to be followers?

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Obſerve. God will ſometimes ſpeak peace to them that are given to follie, or are often found playing the Fool.</hi> Of the truth whereof, as many as ever heard the Goſpel, and did partake of the Grace of it; and are before the Throne, and hope to be there, are as ſo many proofs; witneſſes and living monuments: I ſhall clear what this <hi>ſpeaking of peace</hi> is, in <hi>Three</hi> Steps; He ſpeaks peace to them, 1. In his offering of peace to them; and by his meeting and treating with them in and by that offer, in his intreating or inviting them earneſtly to come to him, who have wearied themſelves, and ſpent their labour on that which profits not; preſſing them to return, and aſſuring them that he will heal their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. And preaching peace through Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. counſelling them to come and <hi>buy eye ſalve</hi> of him, &amp;c. and by his <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and waiting at their <hi>Door</hi> for admittance and entry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Are not theſe words of peace to a fooliſh Church? 2. In making peace with ſome, when (as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.) He not only <hi>Prayes and requeſts</hi> them to be <hi>Reconciled,</hi> but really reconcileth them to himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>Peace be to you, Pardoneth ſin, taketh away the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt them,</hi> giveth them a diſcharge of their debt: that when their <hi>ſin is ſought for, it is not to be found,</hi> becauſe <hi>He hath pardoned it;</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. This is called an <hi>alluring,</hi> or (as the word is) a ſpeaking to the heart. 3. In his not only taking away the Controverſie and making peace; but in his intimating that peace, Saying to the pardoned ſinner, <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgiven thee, go in peace, I am thy Salvation,</hi> and then the promiſe <hi>John</hi> 14.21.23. Is fulfilled, when Chriſt breaks open doors and <hi>comes</hi> in and <hi>Sups,</hi> and <hi>dwels,</hi> his <hi>Father and he:</hi> and one main diſh that is ſet on the Table (to ſay ſo) is <hi>Peace,</hi> as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:179825:91"/> 
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you:</hi> It's peace from God the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt: There are ſome ſpeciall times, wherein God ſpeaks Peace, ſuch as Solemn treating times and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion dayes, and other ſpecial occaſions are, when there hath been more then ordinary diligence in prayer, more then ordinary Sorrow for Sin, peace is readily ſpoken on the back of it: as alſo trying and ſadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing times are uſually times of the intimation of peace: In a word when and where this Goſpel comes and is made lively, Peace followes on it: and this is your time, O! tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> peace may be found to have been ſpoken to many at this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Obſerve,</hi> That, <hi>In and about thoſe times, when God hath ſpoken</hi> (or very urgently offered to ſpeak) <hi>Peace, there is often ſome reſtraint on People, as to the prevailing of their follie:</hi> Some ſtop to the current of Iniquity in it's wonted manner and meaſure, in ſome more and in ſome leſs; ſome more aw of God readily being on people then: Many will have a ſort of Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, like a <hi>Morning cloud and early dew, that ſoon paſſeth away;</hi> Some tickling of their affections, that quickly evaniſheth; as the Lord ſaith of many of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were hearers of <hi>John, Who was a burning and a shining light, that they rejoyced in his light for a ſeaſon:</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12. <hi>Then believed they his words, they ſang his Praiſe; but they ſoon forgat his works, they wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not for his Counſell;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him: Nevertheleſs they flattered him with their lips and lied to him with their Tongues, for their hearts were not right with God, neither were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtedfaſt in his Covenant:</hi> And ſomething of this was alſo, even in Chriſts hearers, and in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who at
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:179825:91"/> firſt <hi>would have plucked out their eyes and given them to Paul:</hi> So in the parable of the Sower, ſome ſeed ſprings up and hath a fair appearance, but ſoon withereth; and other ſome holds out: So likewiſe at Faſts and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions, affections will be readily ſomewhat ſtirred and warmed, and there will be many brave purpoſes and reſolutions, ſuch as were in the people, <hi>Exod</hi> 19. When they ſaid, <hi>All that the Lord commands we will do:</hi> and they look demure and grave like for two or three dayes; The Tippler keeps ſome dayes from the Tavern; He that prayed not in ſecret nor in his family, will, it may be, Pray for ſome time about and after ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; others will go further on; And yet it's but ſome reſtraint on their ſin, or ſome fit and flaſh of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that is tranſient and quickly gone; and <hi>they turn again to follie;</hi> and even the Godly themſelves are here often found, in a great meaſure guilty, as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Note</hi> will clear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Obſerve,</hi> That <hi>even thoſe people and Saints, who have ſometime been given to follie, to whom God hath ſpoken peace, and who have reſtrained their folly for a time thereafter, may much fall back to follie again.</hi> The admonition here given, <hi>Let them not turn again to folly.</hi> Suppoſeth this: This needs not much proof; If ye ſhall go through the Saints recorded in Scripture, ye will find ſad inſtances of it: <hi>David,</hi> after peace was ſpoken to him, falls into adultery and murther; <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after a ſweet word of peace was ſpoken to him, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38. Falls into the follie of Pride and vain oſtentation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 39. <hi>Peter,</hi> after peace ſpoken to him denyeth his Maſter: <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> after peace ſpoken to him, fell once and again into the ſame ſin, and once even after he was reproved for it; as is clear, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.19. and 20. <hi>Chapters:</hi> Or there may be a falling unto ſome
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:179825:92"/> other ſins, or out of one ſin into another; as it was with <hi>David:</hi> This may befall reall Saints, yea eminent Saints, even Pillars in the houſe of God: was there not peace ſpoken to the Diſciples in that ſweet Sermon <hi>John</hi> 14. and 15, and 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> And yet that ſad word followes, <hi>Ye all shall be offended becauſe of me this night;</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> to whom that ſweet word was ſpoken, <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not,</hi> doth foully fall into follie quickly after; what then may befall the more Common ſort of profeſſors, who know not what it is to ſtand before the leaſt tentation? The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this may be <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe the devil falls preſently on, and ſeeks, as it were, with ſeven worſe devils to re-enter the ſoul, and busks this bait of the tentation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it in a new ſhape; old courtiers (to ſpeak ſo) and luſts ſet on and eſſay what hearing they can get. 2. Becauſe though, by peace ſpoken, tentations and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions may be bound up, yea and ſome-what Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: yet they are not ſlain outright, they may lurk for a time, but ſtill live. And 3. Becauſe his People are ready in ſuch a warme Sun blink to grow (as it were) wanton, and under ſuch a ceſſation from their luſts, to caſt by their armes, to grow ſecure, to grow ſomewhat too fain, and to dream of an eaſie life; thus it was in a meaſure with <hi>David,</hi> as he confeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. <hi>I ſaid in my Proſperity, I shal never be moved;</hi> If they get peace for a little, who but they? <hi>They are Lords</hi> (in a manner) <hi>and will not come unto him;</hi> or if they win to a few tears and ſome liberty, they are readily puft up, and in ſome ſort bid their Souls take them reſt; as if they needed to trouble themſelves no more: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are new on-ſets, and the Lord lets them ſee how vain they are, even <hi>in their beſt eſtate:</hi> as we may perceive, in the Lords dealing with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and with
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:179825:92"/> 
               <hi>David,</hi> in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I was troubled.</hi> O! what follie, vanity and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking of corruption do often follow on the back of a ſeeming work of turning to God, and a tender like frame in Profeſſors of Religion? So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. It is ſaid, that <hi>they provoked him at the Sea, even at the red Sea:</hi> Even where and when they were in ſuch a frame, that <hi>they believed his Words and ſang his Praiſe:</hi> they <hi>ſoon forgat his Works,</hi> And <hi>waited not for his Counſel,</hi> which was, in a manner, at the very Table to <hi>lift the heel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him:</hi> And O! how Sad and lamentable a thing is it, to be unwatchfull after a Communion, and an offer or an Intimation of peace!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Obſerve,</hi> That, <hi>There is nothing more called for from a people, who have been given to follie, and have had Peace ſpoken to them, then to take heed that they turn not again to folly,</hi> To take heed that they fall not into the ſame ſins that they ſeemed to have abandoned and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away from: that it be not with them, <hi>According to the true Proverb, The Dog is returned to his vomit,</hi> and <hi>the Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire,</hi> as it is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22. Under which ſimilitude, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle powerfully diſſwades Profeſſors of Religion from turning again to ſin, by ſhewing the loathſomneſs of it: It being as abominable, as a mans licking up again that which he hath vomited. This then is the duty that the Lord calls for: <hi>Firſt</hi> That you ſhould abſtain from the ſins that you have been given to, ſuch as tippling, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drunk, Swearing, Sabbath breaking, neglect of Prayer and the like, and do ſo no more: not only not to relapſe into the ſame ſins, but that ye abſtain from every other ſin: It is not enough that a man break off from one ſin, and take up with another: It is not ſufficient,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:179825:93"/> though a man will not be drunk in his neighbours houſe, if in the mean time in his own houſe he tipple, play the good fellow (as ye call it) and miſpend his time. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye would Conſider, what engagements and reſolutions ye have come under, and that ye fall not back from them: In a word it is, not to be as ye were wont to be: and that ye be found in no known ſin, nor defective in any known duty.</p>
            <p>We come now to the more Particular and cloſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the whole, in theſe <hi>Two Uſes.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, for Advertiſement and warning, <hi>Let him that ſtands take heed leſt he fall,</hi> Let him not look on himſelf as incapable to be ſtollen off his feet: Alace!

            <p>As for the <hi>Firſt, viz.</hi> Wherefore it is, that I doe preſſe this advertiſement: and indeed it is not without very good ground, as ye will eaſily perceive, if, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ye look to and Conſider the beſt Saints and in their beſt condition: how ſoon are even they taken off their feet? Was not <hi>David</hi> often in a very good ſpiritual conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And yet, how ſoon and foully did he fall into fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? was not <hi>Adam</hi> in a good and deſirable condition, when there was no quarrel betwixt God and him, nor any ground for it? And yet how ſoon was he enſnared? Was not <hi>Peter</hi> in a good ſtate and frame, when Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-jona, flesh and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:179825:93"/> blood hath not revealed that unto thee, but my Father who is in Heaven?</hi> And yet within a very litle, he turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo far to folly, as to be the devils inſtrument to tempt Chriſt: as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. Were not the Diſciples in a good condition, when our Lord had Preached to them both the Preparation &amp; thanks-giving Sermons, before and after the Communion? And yet <hi>they all were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended becauſe of him, and forſook him and fled,</hi> And that very quickly, even that ſame very night; Now when ſuch tall Cedars fall, what need have we, who are but in compariſon, ſilly ſhrubs and but as ſmal ſtrawes, to take warning. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we conſider that thoſe ſins and fals were often exceeding <hi>Sudden,</hi> the ſame night, in the Diſciples (as I juſt now hinted,) and in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> very quickly after his recovery: exceeding <hi>foul;</hi> and exceeding <hi>Univerſal,</hi> as in all the Diſciples; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeated, as in <hi>Lot, Jehoshaphat,</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a plurality and variety of them joyned together, as in <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſa,</hi> and in his People at the Red-Sea and in the Wilderneſs: And who knows but the ſame very night, that ye were at the Lords Table, ſome of you were back at your follie? And others of you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night may be. We ſaid, not only <hi>Suddenly,</hi> but <hi>foullie;</hi> as is clear in <hi>Adam,</hi> who when he had no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption formerly, fell from God to the devil (and by the way, many of you are ſo groſly ignorant, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſelf-conceited: that ye think, if ye had been in his caſe, ye would not have done ſo.) And (as I hinted) what foul faults were <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murder, and <hi>Solomons</hi> Idolatrie, at leaſt his tolerating it, after <hi>God had ſpoken twiſe to him?</hi> What a foul fault and fall was that of <hi>Iſraels,</hi> After their ſo Solemn engagements, and fair undertakings. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. When within fourty
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:179825:94"/> dayes they deteſtably and damnably danced before the golden Calfe: &amp; what a foull fall was that of <hi>Peters,</hi> to forſwear Chriſt, by denying him with an oath? And of the reſt of the Diſciples, unkindly &amp; unworthily to forſake him and flee? And who knows, but ſhortly after this occaſion, many of you that have been tipplers, may grow worſe, it may be, even to be found ſtaggering in the ſtreets? And that others of you who prayed not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, may be heard curſing? Ye who are believers and Saints indeed, would Obſerve this, and know that there is need, great need <hi>of watching and Prayer, that ye enter not into Tentation:</hi> And if there hath been any idleneſs, lightneſs, vanity, miſpending of Precious time, or the like; guard, O guard againſt thoſe: The reaſon why Believers fall ſo often in Groſs ſins, is their playing (as it were) with their Petty Idols; little things given way to lead on to greater and worſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Am I now ſpeaking of any ſtrange, uncouth or unpreſidented thing? Have ye never Obſerved, how ye carried and behaved after Communions before? Can ye ſay, but that, as many Communions as ye have been at, there have been as many breaches? If ye have never failed before, ye may be ſecure now; but if ye have failed and Miſ-car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried formerlie, be the more warie and watchful now. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Have ye any knowledge of, and acquaintance with your own hearts? Is your corruption dead? Are your Idols quite ſlain? or are they not rather like to thoſe ſtrange wives, in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, (who were put away) crying on you for pity, (O! cruel pity) and weeping on you to be admitted to come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? And have none of you ſo much fooliſh, fond and cruel Pity, as to ſide with them? Hath a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-day, thruſt out the devil fully? Are there no living luſts, nor ſtrong corruptions within you? Do ye not
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:179825:94"/> ſee what a ready welcome Tentations to ſin are like to get? And find ye not a woful propenſion to be glad, that the reſtraint and aw-band of a Communion day is over and by? And doth not this preſs you to watch? <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Try but how it hath been with you ſince the Sabbath, Is not the bent ye had then, alreadly very much ſlacked? Is not much of that ſeeming or really good frame of Spirit gone? Is not the great part of your work yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you? And is it not a greater difficulty, to make out an engagement, then to make it; to perform, then to Promiſe? How is it then, that ye have in a great part laid by your armes, as if all were done? When ye have, as Souldiers, put your ſelves in battell array, and given your military Oath, and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For the <hi>Second</hi> Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> What it is wherein, or in reference to what we do preſſe your taking warning and being wary? And here I would have you, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To be aware not only of mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

How unſuitable was it for him, to whom the Lord had but a very litle before ſpoken ſuch a great and gracious word of peace, as that; <hi>Depart for I can do nothing, ſo long as thou art here:</hi> and yet the ſame night or the Morrow, this eſcapes him; and readily, when people fall once, they fall over and over again; but ye would be ware to ſeek leave to lurk and loure a while in ſuch <hi>Zoars;</hi> Beware to ſay, it's a litle Sin: ſay not, I ſhall not be drunken, but I muſt have leave to tipple, and triffle over the time; The devil
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:179825:95"/> drives ſin and Tentation, as a Carpenter driveth a wedge: he will teach and Prompt you to ſay, we may be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſport us a while, without regard to the matter, Meaſure or ſeaſon, though ye be not prophane: but, once let in the point of the wedge by a litle ſin, and it may become a great one ere all be done, or a groſſer one may follow, even as the great end of the wedge doth the leſſer. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Beware of returning to Omiſſions. Some, it may be, will reſolve that they will never tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nor Swear, nor Commit any ſuch things; but they will, it may be, neglect and omit to Pray as they have (belike) done theſe few dayes paſt: though they go not abroad to the Tavern on the week dayes, nor go idly in the fields on the Lords-day: yet they may miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend and triffle away their time at home, as if falling back into Omiſſions, were not a turning again to follie, as well as falling back to Commiſſions: The confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many poor Creatures (who become Publickly and Prodigiouſly Scandalous) on their death beds or on a Scaffold, that omiſſions of duty have Prediſpoſed them to, and brought on thoſe groſſe Commiſſions, may and ſhould awake and alarm us: ye would therefore with Holy <hi>Job Make a Covenant with your eyes</hi> and other ſenſes, and make Conſcience to keep it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beware of falling back to a ſecure cold-riſe manner of going about duties of worſhip alone or in Company, in publick or in privat: let none of you think with your ſelves, that now this Solemnitie is over, ye need not wreſtle in Prayer, nor watch ſo ſtrictly over your heart, but let it gad and rove, and not hedge it in on an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Lords day, as on a Communion Lords-day: ſince there is no liberty allowed for an idle word or thought any day, more then there is on that day: Think it not enough that ye ſay your Prayers morning and evening,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:179825:95"/> and that none can charge you with any offence: God the all ſeeing God obſerves you, whether you be univerſall, ſincere and ſerious in the duties of Religion. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Beware of neglecting Spiritual and Goſpel duties: ſuch as, Self-examination or Self-ſearching, Self-denyall, Mortification and uſe making of Chriſt: The neglect of theſe a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the like, may be ſome way called Goſpel-fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: It is no doubt great Goſpel-follie, when Chriſt (being freely and fully offered therein) is not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wiſdom, righteouſneſs, Sanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: when the power of Godlineſs is not aimed at in dutie: but People reſt and ſit down in the form thereof: which yet in ſome reſpect is more comber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome then the power: for Chriſt improved makes all things go eaſily with us: Therefore any of you who have lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ked on it as follie to neglect theſe ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſee that ye return not again to that follie. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Beware of unbelief: have ye not reſolved to caſt out with that evil, and reſolved to be no more jealous of God, though ye ſhould meet with difficulties? Believers in Chriſt, lick not up that vomit again, <hi>turn not again to that follie,</hi> to which there is a ſecret Naturall bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart: If (I ſay) unbelief and jealouſie be a follie, take it not up, turn not to it again. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Beware of heart-ills: poſſibly ye will not give way to more groſs evils: and yet ſuffer your Souls to be carried away after Idols, or after vain, proud, Ambitious, Covetous, Revengeful, filthy and Laſcivious thoughts: but if in very deed Chriſt get the heart, he muſt reign in it and command the Eye, Tongue, Ears, Hands, Feet, and all. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Beware of falling back to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat love of the World, and of letting the heart be too much addicted and glued to, even, lawfull pleaſures &amp; creature-Comforts, to your Callings, Wives, Children,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:179825:96"/> Houſes, Lands and incomes of gain and Profit; from which there hath been poſſibly ſome ſuitable abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs theſe dayes paſt: ye ſhould not only abſtain from oppreſſing. Stealing and deceiving, but ye would alſo guard againſt falling back to exceſſive purſuing after, and (as it were) glutting your ſelves with the things of this world, however lawfull in themſelves. Alace! <hi>Perimus Licitis:</hi> Inordinat love to, and Immoderat pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after things lawful in themſelves deſtroy more ſouls, then things ſinfull and unlawfull in themſelves do: the excuſes of thoſe invited to the Marriage of the Kings Son, are founded not on things ſimply Sinful, but on lawful things, the Farme, Oxen, and Married wiſe: Now the houſe is ſweeped, and ye are in Hazard, if ye guard not, to return to a greater and greedier feeding on thoſe vanities: I dare ſay, there are Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men and Women, who never ſo much hungred for the Communion, as they have longed to have theſe Solemn dayes over and by, that they might win back to their Callings, worldly buſineſſes and pleaſures; O what a wearineſs have they been to them? As Sacred Solemnities were to thoſe ſpoken of, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5. Who cried, <hi>When shall the new Moon be gone, that we may ſell Corn, and the Sabbath day, that we may ſet out Wheat?</hi> To many theſe dayes of Faſting and Spiritual Feaſting and Communicating have been as a bridle bit in their Mouths, to reſtrain them from running on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of their vanity; and who knows, but ere another Communion come, the <hi>Lord may f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Is it not a follie to ſin once? If ſo, ſure, it is much more to relapſe into ſin. Whether is it more true wiſdom to abſtain from thoſe Sins, or to fall back into them: Is it not more wiſdom for you who have been given to Tippling or drunkenneſs, to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Prayer and the like, now to let alone ſins, and to give your ſelves to Prayer, then to be walking in the ſtreet on the <hi>Plain-ſtones?</hi> Is it not more wiſdom to be given to edifieing diſcourſe, then to be laughing and ſporting over the time? Is it not better to come to the Church, then to ſpend the time Idly, In diſcourſing and waiting for a Tentation? And if your conſcience aſſent to the truth of this, then we take witneſs in your Conſcience, that it doth ſo, and this Inſtrument of witneſs will ſtand on record againſt you, if ye ſhall turn to thoſe ſins and to this Folly again. 2. Have ye been examining your ſelves? And do ye find, that much of your life hath been ſpent in folly, by Some <hi>Twenty,</hi> by ſome <hi>Thirty,</hi> by ſome <hi>Fourthy,</hi> by ſome <hi>Fifthy,</hi> by ſome <hi>Sixty</hi> years. And every days account caſt up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts only to folly, vanity and Madneſs? And is it not enough, and may it not ſuffice you, that ye have ſpent ſo long time in folly, though ye ſpend no more ſo? 3. Hath not God been ſpeaking peace to ſome, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:179825:97"/> given them the Intimation of it? So that their Souls have been made to ſay, <hi>God is here:</hi> And have they not gotten the bargain cloſed, and the hand writing that was againſt them torn? We hope, there are ſome ſuch among us? Nay are there any, but the Lord hath been offering peace to them, treating with them, ſaying <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me, Behold me,</hi> intreating and requeſting them to be reconciled? And hath there not been ſome tickling of the affections of many? If ſo, will ye be ſuch fools as to fall back, and to wear out the ſenſe of that peace and warmneſs, that any of you have win to? And ye with whom God hath been meeting and treating about the pardon of ſin, what a folly will it be, in place of getting a diſcharge, to increaſe and multiply your debt? 4 Are there not ſome engagements on you? Or what ever be reall, is there not a profeſſion of coming under engagements? Are not the vowes of God on ſome of you? Is there not ſome ſin that hath ſtared you in the face, which ye have reſolved to abſtain from? And hath there not been ſome ſtirring and ſtickling of deſires to perform what ye have reſolved and engaged to? And will ye break all theſe bands? Will ye repent and rue, that ever ye ingaged to God? If ſo, as ye notably play the fools, So the Lord will be about with you, and even ſpew you out of his Mouth, that ye may puddle your fill in the mire of ſin. 5. Is there not a great bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and propenſion in all naturally to turn again to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? Is there not <hi>an evil heart of unbelief,</hi> ready to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the living God?</hi> I have ſo much Charity for you, as that you will grant this; and when the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Watch,</hi> and tells that <hi>He is at hand that betrayes you,</hi> will ye go ſecurely, and not take warning? O! What deſperat folly would this be? 6. Conſider what will come of it, if ye ſhall fall back, if ye ſlacken your
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:179825:97"/> bent, and growing cold, turn again to folly? ye will wear out any bit of good frame that ye have attained: ye will blur and ſully the reall or ſuppoſed clearneſs of your intereſt, marr your Peace, and become in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more beaſtly and ſwiniſh in your ſinfull way then before; At the very thoughts whereof your hearts ſhould ſcare, Nauſeat and even grow ſick. And what will be the upſhot thereof? Either ye will repent, or never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: If ye ſay, ye will repent; are ye ſure that God will give you Repentance, If ye ſhall hazard on ſome ſin? Are not many given up to hardneſs of heart, who never come to Repentance? Know ye what Repentance is? have ye not been already eſſaying and doing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at Repentance; and have ye not found it difficult and hard to come by? And if ye ſhall ſin yet more, will not Repentance be yet a greater, more difficult and hard work? and ſuppoſe ye ſhould get Repentance, ye ſhall know the truth of that ſaying, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. <hi>That it was an evil and a bitter thing to depart from the Living God, and that his fear was not before your eyes.</hi> O! what ſhame and confuſion of face will it bring with it, to remember that we had ſo Many warnings from the word without, and ſo manie Convictions and challenges from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within, and that yet we went over them, and with a high hand went on in our folly: will thoſe things be litle, think ye? what pleaſure or profit can ye have in <hi>thoſe things whereof ye will be ashamed?</hi> Yea ſuppoſe ye come to repentance (and a hundred to one if ever ye come to it) ye ſhall weep and mourn bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ever ye hazarded ſo on ſin over your light and convictions, and over the belly of your Conſcience?

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:179825:100"/> to the Communion-Table, be forgotten; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them, to repent of them and to renounce them; and when one knot (to ſay ſo) of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement looſeth, caſt another faſter, or if a knot were weak, ſtrengthen it, or caſt a new one; for as acts of Faith muſt be renewed, So muſt acts of engaging to God. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Be much in the exerciſe of Repentance for your bygone folly, <hi>My ſin</hi> (ſaith <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 51.) <hi>Is ever before me;</hi> think not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be the work of a day or two; look back and reflect on your old ſins of tippling, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, enmity at Godlineſs, &amp;c.

But how many fail and come ſhort here? While

Seventhly,</hi> Defer not to make your Reſolutions and engagements practicable; There are many, alace! who think Shame, it ſhould be ſaid, that a Sermon had ſo much weight with them, as to make them alter and change their courſe at once; It may be they will conſent to be religious, but they muſt be allowed to come to it by degrees, &amp; to creep toward it piece-meal; but beware of that, leſt it prove in the Iſſue to be a shift of thy deceitfull heart; Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe words well, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Defer not to pay what thou haſt vowed for the Lord hath no Pleaſure in fools;</hi> And in the Holy Ghoſts account, he is a fool that deferreth and putteth off one moment; O! delayes are in a ſpeciall manner dangerous here, and Sathan will not faill to knit one delay to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Eightly,</hi> Reject all Temptations to ſin and <hi>turning again to folly,</hi> with abhorrency; ſay with <hi>Ephraim, What have I any more to do with Idols?</hi> Never think on them, but with indignation and Holy diſdain; for ye are undone if ye but once liſten to them. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Be often examining, if ye be like and anſwerable to your Communicating, and to your Promiſes and engagements; many know not how it is with them, becauſe they Examine not

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:179825:104"/> together, as it were, into one Lump: though it was a long continued Schiſme, and had much bitterneſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it: yet when their hearts are touched with a Senſe of ſin and of a broken Covenant, their former differences and animoſities evaniſh: ſoftneſs of heart in the ſenſe of by gone ſin, would ſilence many things among us; that all diſputings, writings and Printings will not be able to do: Pray for this to the Land, as the moſt effectuall mean and way of curing out diviſions, and of uniting us in the Lord: It Joins <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> together, whoſe breach was much greater, and of far longer continuance then ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We ſee here, that <hi>A peoples joining and running together in ſerious ſeeking of the Lord is very Commendable and lovely, and a good token and evidence to them of their turning to God and of Gods accepting of them:</hi> even as bitterneſs and diviſion is exceeding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God and prejudiciall to themſelves and to the Work of Grace in them: This is an happy-like, hopeful and promiſing day of Repentance and turning to God, that bodeth much, unſpeakably much good to a land and People.</p>
            <p>But we come to conſider the words as they do direct unto, and chalk out the way for a people returning, to make up a broken Covenant with God, which is the Scope. And we may take it up in theſe <hi>Three, Firſt</hi> As it reſpects the frame of their hearts: And O what a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, humble, warm and mournfull frame are they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be in! <hi>They shall come, and go together,</hi> excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, <hi>going and weeping with their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Zion. Secondly,</hi> As it reſpects and holds forth the great deſigne they have, and that is, to renew and make ſure the Covenant betwixt God &amp; them: Though
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:179825:104"/> it was now broken and they want not challenges for it: Yet they do not ſay, we will never enter in it again, Becauſe we brake it the laſt time we made it: But come (ſay they) let us make it the more firm and ſtable. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As it reſpects and hold out their poſture, and the way which they take in purſuing this deſigne; There is a going and weeping, a praying to and ſeeking of the Lord; in a word they ſeek, and endeavour to renew their Covenant with God, ſeriouſly, diligently and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and thus they purſue their deſigne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, If we look to their frame, we will find implyed in it, 1. A guilty condition. 2. A challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and convinced condition. 3. A repenting conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they are kindly affected with the wrongs done to God, and deſire and uſe means to have them righted.</p>
            <p>We ſhall name <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> generall <hi>Doctrines</hi> from this <hi>Firſt</hi> Conſideration of the word, though in effect it will fall in with the <hi>Laſt.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is this, That <hi>Gods Covenanted People may deal foully and falſly in his Covenant;</hi> For their coming to renew the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſuppoſeth that they had broken it; and it's alſo implyed in their mourning and weeping, and ſaying, <hi>Come and let us join our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant never to be forgotten.</hi> This needs no further proof then the Hiſtory of Gods People, their dealing with him; which holds out clearly and convincingly the ſtrong Propenſion and bent of heart that is naturally in them to back-ſlide, and like a deceitfull bow to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and to prove unſtedfaſt in his Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is here implyed A diſtance betwixt God and them following on the breach of Covenant; Their going to ſeek the Lord ſaith, that he is a ſeeking; this is very ſad, yet moſt true, that <hi>Sin and unfaithfull dealing in Gods Covenant will make a ſeparation betwixt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:179825:105"/> him and a People in Covenant with him:</hi> Thus it's ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.1. <hi>The Lords hand is not shortened, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear; but your iniquities have ſeparated betwixt you and your God:</hi> It's very like, that many believe not this, that ſin hath ſuch influence in making ſeparation betwixt God and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but in that day when an eternall ſeparation ſhall be made betwixt God and them, It will be undenyably made known and manifeſt, when many of you that now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rong to the Ordinances will, if Grace prevent not, meet with that ſentence (O dreadfull ſentence!) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me ye workers of iniquitie, I never knew you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is here their ſenſibleneſs of both theſe, 1. That they had broken Covenant. 2. That God bad ſeparated himſelf and withdrawn his Preſence from them for their breach of Covenant; though ſin be very evil, and the want of Gods Preſence very ſad; yet they had this good, that they were kindly ſenſible of both: whence we may <hi>Obſerve,</hi> That <hi>Conviction of by gone wrongs done to God, and kindly reſenting of his abſence, are the firſt riſes and ſprings of Repentance and turning to God;</hi> or they are <hi>the firſt ſteps of Converſion:</hi> What is it, I pray, that all this buſineſs and ſtir among this People flows from? Here it is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> They apprehend a quarrell betwixt God and them, And <hi>next</hi> they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a diſtance: &amp; this puts them ſeriouſly to mind turning to God with weeping and ſupplications, and to renew their Covenant for recovering of Gods preſence: this ſame is the Spirits Method, <hi>John</hi> 16 <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord Chriſt) <hi>ſend the ſpirit,</hi> and the firſt thing he doth is this; <hi>He convinceth the world of ſin:</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. the firſt thing that ever (to ſpeak ſo) turned the chaſe in <hi>Peters</hi> hearers was, that <hi>they were pricked in their hearts</hi> for ſin; and this did put them to an adviſement,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:179825:105"/> and to cry out, <hi>Men and brethren what shall we do?</hi> And indeed there is a neceſſitie of this, Conſidering the Lords way of adminiſtring his Grace; for ſo long as perſons are not convinced of their ſin, they are not apprehenſive of a quarrell; but conviction of ſin makes them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of it, and to think, that they would be oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any who would relieve them out of that ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: and while God is abſent and not miſſed, they ſleep on; and though he be abſent, yet they know it not, as <hi>Samſon</hi> knew not that God had left him, till he went out to <hi>shake himſelf:</hi> But when Gods departure becometh ſenſible, it will make a wicked <hi>Saul</hi> to howl, and will make a gracious tender Soul to take the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme hot; and we ſee, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. and 5. Where the Bride miſſing Chriſt, is put to ſeeking, and ſtill miſſing him, her heart is keeped fluttering and on wing in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing after his preſence, till ſhe recover and find it.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the Point, we would <hi>Exhort</hi> you to let this truth ſink in your hearts: there is a neceſſity of the conviction of theſe <hi>Two,</hi> 1. Of wrongs done to God. 2. Of Gods abſence, ere ye can be ſerious in the exerciſe of repentance and turning to God: what is the cauſe that many ly ſtill in deep ſecurity with much debt upon their ſcore, and ly down and riſe up without Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Even this, that they never had it, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled for the want of it; they were never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and made ſenſible of their Sin: now this convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not, ſimply to know that we have ſin, as many take it to be, who think it enough that they know that they are ſinners: but It's ſuch a Conviction as arreſts the ſinner before God, and puts him to anſwer for his Sin: It's like an officer coming with an order to put a man in Priſon for debt: be may go confidently and ſtoutly enough up and down the ſtreet under the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:179825:106"/> of his debt: But when He is arreſted for it by the officer, it affects him, and toucheth him in the quick: ſo is it with a Soul throughly convinced of ſin: Men may know that they are ſinners, but the Conſcience for a time may, not much trouble them, and they may take on more to a long day, and ſhift challenges and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions: but when the Conſcience awaketh and the law arreſteth them, the matter ſinks deeper on them: would ye then know what is a ſuitable frame for Faſting and Communicating? We would Commend this to you, even to Study a thorowneſs of the Conviction of ſin, and to be ſenſible of the diſtance that is betwixt God and you, and narrowly to obſerve whether he be preſent or abſent: It's very ſad and much to be Lamented, that many who are ignorant of the way of God ſhould be ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the goodneſs of their Condition, that there is no acceſs for any word ſo much as once to bear upon them: If we ſhould a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k many of you, whether are ye throughly convinced of your wrongs done to God, and ſenſible of the diſtance betwixt him and you? ye would readily anſwer, that ye never wanted nor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him: he hath been always your God, and ye have been always his people: not from any ſtrength of Faith, but from ignorance, ſtupidity and carnall Preſumption; yea many of you have not ſo much knowledge as to cover your ignorance and Hypocriſie, neither can any gain the leaſt ground of you, to make you ſenſible that your faith and Communion with God are unſound and deluſory, becauſe they have not had a right riſe from conviction of ſin and of diſtance from God, putting you on to repentance and covenanting with him. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſeverall perſons will be ready to think and ſay, that they have convictions of ſin: as indeed there is much ground and reaſon for them: I ſhall point at ſome
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:179825:106"/> convictions, for which there is Juſt ground, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye may know if your Convictions have been thorow and ſound: moſt whereof, if not all of them may be gathered from the words. 1. There is a Conviction of the want of Faith: The holy Spirits firſt work, <hi>John</hi> 16.9. Is to <hi>convince the world of ſin, becauſe they believe not on him:</hi> Were ye ever convinced of your unbelief: Many will be convinced of Sabbath-breaking, of curſing, Swearing, lying. Drunkenneſs, &amp;c. to be ſins, who were never convinced of the ſin of their want of Faith, for they always had it, as they think: and what, I pray, can ſuch as ye do at a faſt or humiliation for ſin, when this is your great ſin, and ye cannot by any means be brought to take with it, though you take with other ſins; but can come boldly to the Table of the Lord as Believers, and ſuch as have no juſt reaſon to doubt of the ſoundneſs of your Faith, while in the mean time, all the Faith that ye have, is but rotten preſumption: This is a moſt fearfull condition: for ſo long as ye think that ye have Faith, ye cannot think your ſelves to be loſt: neither can ye caſt your ſelves down with a ſtopped mouth before God: nor is there acceſs for any word from him to do you good. A 2d. Conviction or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is of or for the want of a new nature? were ye ever convinced of this? not only, of this and that and the other particular ſin, but that ye were in a ſinfull and unrenewed ſtate? <hi>Nicodemus John</hi> 3. comes to Chriſt and ſpeaks him fair; but the Lord lets him know that fair words, a great Profeſſion, and ſome, yea much knowledge will not do the turn, he muſt neceſſarily have ſomewhat elſe, even a new nature, <hi>He muſt be born again, elſe he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> He is very unwilling and loth to digeſt that Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine; but the Lord tells him, that, <hi>that which is born
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:179825:107"/> of the flesh is flesh:</hi> It were good that many of you had that word from your heart in your Mouth, which is <hi>Jere.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I shal be turned:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of a naturall ſtate, Alace! are very rare; If any of you have had ſuch Convictions, try what became of them, and what followed on them. A <hi>Third</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or challenge is, of or for former breaches of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, For Goſpel ſins and the ſin of dealing unfaithfully in Gods Covenant: and can any of you ſhift this Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, conſidering what ye were tyed to in Baptiſme, and by other vows and engagements which ye have come under ſince that time, eſpecially at the Lords Supper? How few of thoſe have been kept? or rather have they not been as ſo many ropes of Sand? And who are ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably challenged for and convinced of ſuch breaches, as it is implyed here, that theſe People are? A <hi>Fourth</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is, of want of Gods preſence, inſinuated in their <hi>Going to ſeek the Lord,</hi> which imports an abſence of God, and that ſinfully procured by them, for which they weep and are kindly affected: the abſence of God ſimply conſidered is no ground of challenge, it being an act of Soveraignty; but abſence procured through our ſin is a great ground of challenge: Alace! the moſt part know not, neither are acquainted with any ſuch Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge: they think God is always with them: However, the Lord is abſent, and it would well become us to ſearch out diligently that which hath procured his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; for whatever may be Gods end in it, there is abundant ground of Juſt challenge that we may get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves in it. A <hi>Fifth</hi> Ground of challenge is, in reſpect of their own ſtupidity and ignorance, which have incapacitated them to take up the way how to come to God for making up the breach, therefore <hi>They ask the way to Zion:</hi> And this may be another ſad challenge to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:179825:107"/> many; who though their ignorance, ſenſleſneſs and ſtupidity have utterly indiſpoſed and unfitted themſelves to make their peace with God, and are without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way how to vent their deſires to him. A <hi>Sixth</hi> Challenge implied is, the want of love to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and a Challenge for ſeen diſtance betwixt God and them helps to bear in on them this Challenge for diſtance betwixt one another: Therefore now they ſay, <hi>Come and let us join our ſelves:</hi> this is another challenge, which we ſhould not ſhift: it is too evident, what ever our profeſſions be, that we are much cooled and fallen behind in our Love to one another. A <hi>Seventh</hi> Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge is, lying long under a ſeen evil condition without being ſuitably affected with it: therefore theſe People go now with the more tenderneſs about the work of turning to God, and of their renewing Covenant with him, that they were ſo long a falling to it: I ſuppoſe many of you, who never knew what Repentance was, and others alſo who have been more ſerious then now they are, may have this challenge: It is no Strange nor uncouth thing that is called for from us, to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for Faſts and Communions, it is even ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in theſe moſt plain, Common and Obvious things: and if ye can hold up your faces and ſay, that theſe concern you not nor the Preſent occaſion, ye may wave and lay them aſide: but if they be ſuch things as your Conſciences convince you of: it is moſt neceſſarie, that ye take time to think upon them and lay them to Heart: and that ye ſtudy through Grace to be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them before the Lord.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that we intended mainly to ſpeak a word to at this time, is this, that <hi>There is no amending or righting of an ill condition, but by making
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:179825:108"/> ſure and faſt the Covenant betwixt God and us.</hi> What is the remedie of this Peoples ill condition here, when they find themſelves ſo far wrong? <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and let us join our ſelves to the Lord in a Perpetuall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, never to be forgotten:</hi> when I ſpeak here of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting, as that on which the quieting of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the remedie of things wrong in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth ſo much depend: It is not to be underſtood of a bare Promiſe only to right and amend things that are wrong and amiſs; but it is to be underſtood of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Covenanting with God, of a reall and cordiall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the offer of Jeſus Chriſt made to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, whereby an union betwixt God and us through him as Mediator is made up: wherein there is Gods offer and Promiſe, on the one ſide: and our Faith accepting of and ſubmitting to the terms and Conditions on which the offer is made, on the other ſide: whereupon there followeth a mutuall cloſed bargain betwixt God and us: or the very bargain is thus made up: And ſo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever way we look upon and conſider our condition as evil or ſad, whether in reſpect of challenges for and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of ſin and of wrongs done to God: or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of darkneſs, uncleanneſs &amp; confuſion: or in reſpect of Croſſes and afflictions, this is the way to win at the remedy thereof: thus <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 5. When he is drawing near to Death, and hath many challenges for things that had been wrong in his Perſonall walk and in his houſe, which had brought on it much affliction and trouble, and when he finds himſelf very infirm, and un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der the want of much of that lively ſenſe he had won to have, he betakes himſelf to this, <hi>Though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>My houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all things and ſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and this is all my Salvation and all my deſire, though h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:179825:108"/> make it not to grow:</hi> And if we look on the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. When he is under a conviction of his Sin and miſery, what reſolves he upon as a remedy? <hi>I will go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to my Father, and I will ſay; Father, I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt thing he betakes himſelf to and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon, is, to catch hold of the Covenant relation betwixt his Father and him. And there is a neceſſity of this on a <hi>Threefold</hi> account, 1. Becauſe there can be no ſolid ground for extricating and bringing one out of an evil condition, but by Covenanting with God; for what elſe, I pray, can ſilence a challenge, or quiet and calme the Conſcience in reſpect of guilt, when it ſaith to the perſon, thou haſt ſinned and art liable to the Curſe? There is no way to get ſin and the Curſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but by fleeing to Jeſus Chriſt, and cloſing with Gods offer of Pardon upon the account of His Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſted on by Faith: Therefore is faith compared to a <hi>shield, whereby we may quench the fierie darts of the devil;</hi> It's true, ſaith the Soul accuſed of enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt and wrongs done to God, I was an enemie to him and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eatly wronged him, I was liable to his curſe and wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h for ſin; but he offered me Pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation through the Mediator, and I have accepted of his offer, and do reſt upon Chriſts ſatisfaction for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, therefore I am Juſtified and ſhall not come into condemnation. 2. Becauſe there can be no peace to the Soul, till there be ſome thorow evidence that the Covenant is fixed and made ſure; for this is the way that God hath laid down for making Peace; as the quarrell and curſe are founded on the breach of one Covenant, ſo our peace ariſeth upon our engaging with God in another Covenant: Hence are all thoſe promiſes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.31, 32, 33. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. which are ſo often repeated, <hi>I will Pardon their iniquities, I will remember
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:179825:109"/> their ſins no more,</hi> &amp;c. All which Promiſes being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of a Covenanter with God, whoever would look for the Performance of the Promiſes, there is a neceſſitie of their being in Covenant with him, ere they can expect the performance of them and attain to Peace. 3. Becauſe, all that are without the Covenant of Grace are under the curſe, being lyable to the breach of the firſt Covenant: Therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. Theſe two are put together, <hi>Strangers from the Covenant of Promiſe; and having no Hope, being without God and Chriſt in the World;</hi> and ſo to be without the Covenant, is to be without Hope, and without God and without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe,</hi> 1. Lay this for an unqueſtionable ground, that if ever ye be well, it muſt be by this Covenant with God: is there any conviction of ſin, of violating by gone engagements to God, and of wrongs done to him? take it for a certain truth, that things muſt be thus adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thus ſecured betwixt God and you; that ye muſt have pardon &amp; peace by entring into, &amp; making ſure the new Covenant with God on the Grounds of his own grace; That is, when God is treating with you &amp; declaring that he is content to cloſe with you, on Condition, that ye will take with your ſin, renounce your own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſubmit to Chriſts, and be content to live to him all the days of your life that are behind; ſtep to &amp; cloſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gers to God and without the Covenant? Did ye ever experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know any good that his word did to you, as to the bringing of you under the bond of the Covenant? Hath any gracious Change followed upon it? The truth is, many of you think that ye may go to Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, and the ſaving effects of it on your hearts: ye found them (as ye fancy) always inclined to love God: ye ſuppoſe that ye were alwayes in friendſhip with him: which, though there were nothing elſe to prove it, is a manifeſt evidence, that ye were never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in friendſhip with him. But let me ask yet further, did ye ever know what it was, to make uſe of Chriſts mediation, in the making up of a Covenant betwixt God and you? It's like, ye will ſay, ye prayed: but ye might have done that, though Chriſt had never come into the World, and though there had been no ground for your acceptance on his account: but I ſay again, what uſe made ye of his mediation and ſufferings? I fear ye know little or nothing at all of this; but ye come to him, becauſe ye imagine that he bears a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to all ſinners, and is very eaſie to be dealt with, and that God the Father is more inexorrable and a harder partie to deal with then he; as if Jeſus Chriſt the Son were not as Juſt as the Father; Or as if God the Father were not as ready, through a mediator, to accept of ſinners, as the Son is: I would ask you yet further, do ye think, or can ye with any Juſt reaſon think, that your Covenant is ſure, when ye know neither what it is, nor how ye have entered into it? In the Covenant, as there is an offer on Gods ſide; ſo there muſt be a

            <p>COvenanting with God, if it be real, well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſure, is a buſineſs of incomparably greateſt concern and advantage to ſinners; but when it is otherwiſe, and only Imagined without any Solid ground; it's attended with the greateſt diſapoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Prejudice imaginable; a man in that caſe fancieth himſelf to be in a ſtate of Friendſhip and favour with God, while, in the mean time, he is an enemy to God, and God an enemy to him; and is there any diſappointment or diſadvantage in the world comparable to that? It is one great end and deſigne of all Ordinances, that ſtrangers to God by nature may be engaged to him, and made to become his Covenanted People; It was for this end that Chriſt came into the world and laid down His life and ſhed his precious Blood, even to bring Sinners
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:179825:112"/> into a Covenant of Reconciliation and friendſhip with God; and therefore the Ordinance, that is now approaching, is called the new <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>New Teſtam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſitian, and another which a ſick man hath: it is of the latter that we mean here. <hi>Secondly,</hi> From a Conviction of the want of Gods Company: Theſe here know now, though they be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that yet they are nevertheleſs naturally enemies to God and Chriſt and without both, and therefore they ſeek him, and to make a Covenant with him. There are ſome that pretend to be ſeeking God and Chriſt, and yet they have him, they think, always in their hearts: But ſpeak ſo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berly, did ye ever want or miſs him? It may be, at the one word ye will ſay, we hope not, and at the next word, Perhaps, too often: and it is ſtill but a gueſſing at the beſt: when the <hi>Prodigall</hi> came to himſelf, he ſaw that he had been (to ſpeak ſo) in the wrong cloſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This well qualified deſire hath a kindly heart ſoftneſs with it, which is a good, though a very rare thing: <hi>They go</hi> here <hi>weeping,</hi> and when they are a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words, <hi>Come and let us join to the Lord in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> their tears are trickling down: It's a good and hopeful deſire, which is expreſſed with the tear in the eye: proceeding from a ſuitably affected heart: There
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:179825:117"/> are Alace! many of our deſires that do not kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, neither do they make any change: the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth dead, ſtiff and hard under them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This well qualified deſire puts on to diligence, and is not like the ſluggards deſire: therefore <hi>they go and ſeek the Lord:</hi> they are eager and earneſt in the matter and are taken up with it: This deſire will make the man ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forget to eat his bread and it may be to Pray ſeven times a day (what if I had ſaid twice ſeven times?) and very oft to with draw from all company, at leaſt, that is not edifieing and profitable, and to retire to the fields or to the Chamber, quietly to lay, as it were, a chaſe by the purſuit of Faith to the finding out of Gods Company: It will make him and her go to the pooreſt body in all the town or village, that is gracious, <hi>to ask the way to Zion:</hi> this is alſo a very rare thing: ye all know the way to Heaven, as ye think, and this makes you fooliſhly confident, till ye run your ſelves into the mire and into the pit at laſt, if Grace, by making a ſaving change, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>event not. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This well qualified deſire is a humbling deſire, there is no pleading here with God, of the priviledge of their Relation they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the Covenant made with him: they cannot find in their hearts, nor have they confidence to do that: they Judge themſelves to be very unlike him, and they carry humbly towards one another, glad to ask the way at, and to get ſome knowledge of it from one another, how they may win forward: they are like the Spouſe, who ſaith to the Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem, Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>If ye ſee my Beloved, tell him that I am ſick of Love,</hi> take my Commendations (as if ſhe had ſaid) to him and lay out my caſe before him: ſuch ſerious and humble Souls will be glad to take help in the way from any body that can give it, which ſaith, that they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:179825:117"/> are diligent and Painfull. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This deſire, as it may, is always ſetting forward; <hi>they</hi> are <hi>going</hi> and <hi>ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way;</hi> and though they have a ſtrong tide (as it were) againſt them, yet the wind of their own deſire and impulſe ſteereth them through and maketh them Stem the Port; and though they make but flow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, yet it is always towards <hi>Zion. Sixthly,</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is a Peremptory and (to ſay ſo) an illimited deſire, and that in a twofold reſpect, 1. In reſpect of coming at God. It muſt have him and will not ſubmit to the want of him, Communion with him it muſt have. 2. In this reſpect, that it maketh no Conditions with God of its own, but is heartily well content to take him on his own terms: This indeed is a notably good mark of a well qualified deſire, when a Soul deſires not ſo much to be at Heaven as to be at God, and when it is (as I Juſt now ſaid) content to take him on his own terms: many will deſire God and Heaven, but with ſome ſuch ſecret reſervation as this, that they get leave to brook their luſts and Idols, that they may have liberty to tipple and triffle away their time, to take their fill of the World, to be in credit and reputation and to purſue after ſome one thing or other in the World; or at leaſt they muſt be allowed to go about the eſtabliſhing of their own righteouſneſs: but this deſire is waited with the abandoning of all Idols, without any allowed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or reſervation, and with the renouncing of ſelf-righteouſneſs alſo in the Point of Juſtification; and therefore it's called, <hi>Submitting to the Righteouſneſs of God;</hi> It ſays not a word againſt the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but holds all: theſe things were good to be ſeriouſly thought on, and ſought after, in our approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Table of the Lord, to renew our Covenant with him; and where they are not in ſome meaſure, our
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:179825:118"/> deſires will not be found to be of the light kind; it were therefore very ſuitable for you, to think, how ye may get your hearts quickened and warmed with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and unquenchable deſires after this covenanting with God, and after the water of life; O! know ye any thing of this? There are ſome who have found it in experience and who can repreſent it better to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then we can exp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Grace of God works ſuch deſires as have another ſort of edge on them, and have a holily diſquieting and reſtleſs hunger for the breaſts of Gods Covenant, and cannot reſt nor be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yea no not live without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly Obſerve,</hi> That <hi>A people or perſon may have ſome ſincere deſires after Covenanting with God, and yet have much weakneſs, many infirmities and fears in the accomplishing of that their deſigne.</hi> Many poor puzzled and perplexed ſouls may have this honeſt deſire, and yet not know well how to put the thing in Practice; even like unto theſe mentioned here, who are going toward <hi>Zion</hi> to join themſelves to the Lord in Covenant, and yet are asking the way: they have covenanting with God in their eye as their great ſcope, but are ignorant in a Conſiderable meaſure of the way; yet they ſit not ſtill till they get the way (as it were) deſcribed on a Card to them: but they riſe and make forward as they may. I nothing doubt, the truth of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is known in experience by ſome Serious, though much toſſed and puzzled Souls, who have ſome honeſt and earneſt longings after him and after Covenanting with him: who yet know not well how to win at him, or
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:179825:118"/> how to make this Covenanting Practicable: thus the honeſt well meaning Daughters of <hi>Jeruſal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e they have laid him:</hi> It was an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the honeſty of her deſire, that though ſhe knew not where he was: yet ſhe could not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by any thing from a mournfull reſtleſs and diligent Purſuit after his preſence. This may Proceed Partly, in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, from believers their infirmity, and their not being thorough in the knowledge of Goſpel Myſteries: from their ignorance of the Parties and conditions of the Covenant, of the nature, Properties, and promiſes of it: If they knew how kind and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending the Lord is: how near he brings his Word: How litle he will take of their hand: how ſolid the Covenant is; how ſure the cautioner is, and how their Part of the Covenant is undertaken for as well as Gods; they would not have ſuch doubts and fears; hence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. They who are weak in knowledge are ſaid to be <hi>weak in faith,</hi>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:179825:119"/> Becauſe through their Ignorance they have many doubts: This makes me to think, that if many of you had ſincerity and ſeriouſneſs in the great concern of your Salvation, ye would be much and almoſt inextricably Puzzled, how to Rid your ſelves in many things ye would meet with in your condition, becauſe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunding of your ignorance; ye cannot Alas! tell what Repentance is, what cloſing with Chriſt in the Covenant is, what Chriſts offices are, and what uſe ſhould be made of them; and therefore if ye were put in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o any ſtrait or Dump through the ſenſe of ſin, it needed be no great wonder that ye ſhould be in much confuſion and did not know what to do to get out of it. It were good, therefore, that ye ſtudied the knowledge of God and of the Covenant; that if ever God do you good, ye may have ſome clearneſs and diſtinctneſs in the way of the Remedy of your evils, and of extricating you out of your difficulties. But that which keeps many quiet, is, Alace! their own Preſumption grown to a great height, and the devils rocking them faſt aſleep in the cradle of Securitie: it's a wonder to ſee ſo many very confident of Peace with God, who yet know not how it is come at: when God touches your Conſcience, ye will be put to cry, what ſhall we do? Becauſe of your ignorance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It proceeds partly from want of experience; hence, though ſome, it may be, have light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: yet wanting experience of the thing, they are at a ſtand and know not what to do in this or that caſe; Juſt as if a man were to go to <hi>London,</hi> and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all the Towns and Poſts in the way; yet when he comes to advance in his Journey not having gone the way before; he is often in doubt whether he be right; So it is with many, who from literall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can tell what faith and Repentance is, but when
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:179825:119"/> their Spirits are Jumbled (to ſpeak ſo) confuſed and put through other; the matter looks far otherwiſe upon them: and they are like a man who coming to a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſafe foord of a River that is mudded, yet fears to take it, becauſe he hath not ridden it before: whereas another that hath gone thorow it, can confidently hazard on it; and indeed it is no Marvell to ſee much of this even amongſt Believers. A <hi>Third,</hi> cauſe or ground whence this may proceed, is, prejudices at the way of God, and of perſons at themſelves: men have natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſort of Goſpel of their own that they cannot go by, till ſomeway they be conſtrained: and when God puts them to it, they are at a ſtand: as for inſtance, there is this Prejudice in ſome, that they think none can go and warrantably take hold of Gods Covenant till they be ſo and ſo humbled: that they cannot go with Convictions &amp; Challenges, till they get ſome more deep heart-work, or be in a better and more tender frame, Hence <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. very unreaſonably, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man, O Lord;</hi> whereas <hi>David</hi> reaſoned otherwiſe and much more Pertinently, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. when he ſaith, <hi>Pardon my iniquity, for it is great:</hi> and hence the queſtion ariſeth, what ſhall we do? and when they are bidden believe: they Object, Ah! we are ſinners, and have evil and hard hearts, and are unhumbled: look what Paſſed betwixt <hi>Peter</hi> and his heaters, <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. He layeth out before them their horrid guilt in <hi>crucificing Chriſt:</hi> they <hi>are Pricked in their hearts,</hi> and cry, <hi>what shall we do?</hi> He bids them <hi>Repent and be Baptized,</hi> which takes in Faith, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 41. It's ſaid, that ſuch as were kindly touched, <hi>Gladly received the Word;</hi> Now I pray, what if they had objected can we that have even now, or a very li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:179825:120"/> of Chriſt Believe on him? Come away (ſaith he on the matter) for there is no other way to Pardon and Peace with God: there was much of this in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times amongſt the Chriſtian <hi>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Hebrews,</hi> many Prejudices at and wrong conceptions of the Goſpel and Covenant of Grace: and therefore they would have patched up a Goſpel of Grace &amp; of works: they would have brought in the Ceremonies of the Law and eſtabliſhed a ſelf-righteouſneſs: and this in particular is one great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that the devil Laboureth deeply to poſſeſs the minds of wakened ſinners with, even to make them think that it's Preſumption for them, though they would fain do it, to come to Chriſt and by Faith to cloſe with him, unleſs they be ſo and ſo qualified: as long as they are ſecure, he makes them take their Preſumption for Faith: but the next day when they are wakened and exhorted to betake themſelves to Chriſt by Faith, he calls that alſo Preſumption: and indeed, as it is Satans manner to drive Sinners on extremes, So it is our way to run into extrems: that which made us call our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption Faith, is the ſame which makes us call our Faith preſumption: becauſe we lay it for a ground, that it is our honeſtie or good diſpoſition, and ſo and ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied frame, that muſt commend us to God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while we conceive that we have that, it's the ground of our preſumption, and when the Conſcience is waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and we find that we want that, we cannot believe. A <hi>Fourth</hi> Cauſe or ground whence this, in ſome, may proceed, who would fain believe, is not ſo much their darkneſs and ignorance of the way, as the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, frowardneſs, and deceit of their heart, that will not, for them, come up to it: ſuch are puzzled and perplexed what to do, becauſe they cannot get it well
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:179825:120"/> done &amp; as they would: ſuch are like a good Archer that can ſhoot well, but hath a deceitfull bow, which when he hath put his Arrow on the ſtring and hath drawn it to the very head ſtarts aſide and makes him quite miſſe his mark the fault and defect is not in the mans skill, but in the Bow: we the rather make uſe of this Compariſon, that the Holy Ghoſt doth ſo in the Scripture, reſembling our heart to a <hi>deceitfull bow that turns aſide:</hi> So that, they who are acquainted with their own hearts, know not what to do with them, how to guide them, and bring them up unto or bold them at any thing that is good; and though, it may be, they could to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe give directions to others in ſuch a caſe: yet they find their own hearts very untractable to admit of them, as if they did not ſuit or meet with their own caſe. This is indeed a very puzzling difficultie, yet to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Souls there is no new direction to be given, but the renewed exerciſe of faith, and to put the directions, which they know, in practice; and when one ſhot (to ſpeak ſo) miſgives, to eſſay another, not to ſeek (as it were) a new ſtring, but to caſt a new knot on it, and if two knots ſhould ſlip, to caſt a third, improving more that Grace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Covenant to make them hold better; Therefore, <hi>Acts</hi> 2 When thoſe pricked in their hearts ask, what they ſhall do, <hi>Peter</hi> bids them Repent: they were begun to do ſo, and he bids them be doing and go on: ye then that are indeed ſerious, and to whom your ſhort comings are really your Souls burden, would not think it any uncouth, ſtrange or extraordinary thing, to find deſire and affection running far before your light and practiſe, (though ye would endeavour to have them foot-ſide) a Chriſtians deſire may be a dayes Journey (as it were) before himſelf, as to his attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and indeed in ſome reſpect it would not be good,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:179825:121"/> if it were otherwiſe, for it is no good ſigne of progreſs in Gods way, when the deſires of Perſons go no further length then their Practiſe, or when they their Practice falls nothing ſhort of their deſires: both in that caſe are to be much ſuſpected: for even eminently Holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſees himſelf to be behind, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. when he ſaith, <hi>I think not my ſelf perfect, but one thing I do forgetting things that are behind and reaching forth to thoſe things that are before; I preſs towards the mark:</hi> Where he came one Poſt in his attainment, His deſire was ten, in a manner before him: and ſo is it with thoſe people here ſpoken of, <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Let us Join our ſelves to the Lord;</hi> they find themſelves to be behind, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to work themſelves up, and to draw themſelves, and one another forward: we muſt now draw to a cloſe, and ſhall therefore but touch the following <hi>Obſervations</hi> and paſs them in a word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly Obſerve,</hi> that <hi>in Peoples covenanting with God, their deſires and deſignes will be much ſooner Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and laid down, then they will be got accomplished and put inexecution, or then they will win to ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein:</hi> although an Union be betwixt Chriſt and them, yet they are not ſatisfied, till they be ſome-what clear and diſtinct about it: they are like the Prodigal, who being in another and ſtrange Countrey, ſaith firſt, <hi>I will go,</hi> then he ariſeth: and, <hi>I will ſay to my Father,</hi> before he actually ſpeak to his Father himſelf: calling him <hi>Father:</hi> Some reall acting of Faith Preceeds his more diſtinct ct ſatisfieing acting of it: there is a faith in reſolving to believe, before there be a reſting of Faith or ſtayed believing: and yet it's Faith that begets that ſame reſolution: if the Prodigal had not had ſome Faith of <hi>enough in his Fathers houſe,</hi> and of his Fathers affection, he would not have reſolved to go home: and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:179825:121"/> theſe people mentioned here would not have ſet their faces towards <hi>Zion;</hi> if they had not had ſome begun ſtirrings of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly Obſerve,</hi> That it is <hi>a good token to be asking ſeriouſly the way to Heaven, though the askers be not ſo clear in it:</hi> there is ſome ground to think that ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in the way, and if they hold on and fo low the directions of the word, they may come thither: It is far better to be diſſatisfied and to ask the Way: then not to ask, and yet to be ſatisfied with our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly Obſerve,</hi> that <hi>Perſons may fall very far short of their deſire, and have much infirmitie, and may meet with many puzzling difficulties how to accomplish what they would be at: yet where a ſerious and longing deſire is wakened after Covenanting with God, they should go forward and follow it forth.</hi> This people are ſhort of what they deſired, and yet they go, and they know not (as it were) where to ſet down the next foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> till they ask the way, yet they go on ſtill asking: there is no diſputing here, but forward we ſhould go: I ſuppoſe theſe here ſpoken of might have had ſeverall difficulties ſtarted and ſeverall obſtructions laid in their way, yet on they go: as, <hi>Firſt</hi> This, that they were Covenant breakers: yet they, taking ſeriouſly with it, ſtep over that, and ſay notwithſtanding, <hi>Come let us join our ſelves to the Lord in a Covenant. Secondly,</hi> they might have thought, that it was a very long Journey, and that they would never be able to go thorow to the end of it: beſides that they were under the dominion of ſtrange Kings who were <hi>Heathens:</hi> So it may be ſaid on the matter, and is often ſaid to ſerious Souls, that would fain believe, can ye believe? It will not be with you: are ye not under the feet of many Tyrannous luſts?
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:179825:122"/> And how will ye win free from them? yet they reſolve and muſt, yea dare not but reſolve to go forward: and the reaſon is, becauſe they reſolve to take with their guilt and to make uſe of the Covenant for anſwering and ſilencing of challenges: and they reſolve alſo, if the Journey be long, to make uſe of the Covenant for ſtrength to make them hold on and hold out in it. The weak Believer when ſuch doubts are ſtarted, ſhould make uſe of the Promiſes of the Covenant, ſuch as theſe; <hi>Faithfull is he who hath called you, who alſo will do it,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Return back ſliding Children, and I will heal your back-ſlidings,</hi> ſaith the Lord; and then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>Behold we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God. Jer.</hi> 3.22. They yeeld themſelves to the Lord. A <hi>Third</hi> Difficultie is their ignorance; they might have ſaid, we know not the way, and how can we think to come where we deſire and deſigne to be? (as ſome will be ready to ſay, we can tell ſome words of the Catechiſme, but Alace! We know not what it is to believe) yet they ſit not ſtill for all this, but as one Remedy of their ignorance, <hi>they ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward.</hi> And if ye <hi>Ask</hi> here, how can their faces be thitherward, when they are a king the way? And at whom do they ask the way. The Gentiles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they live know it not, and they have no other to ask at? <hi>I anſwer,</hi> they are hanging on God, and taking their <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>meaths</hi> of the way, as he gives them from his word; and there is a moſt ſweet word for ſuch, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35.8. where the Lord ſpeaking of this way, and calling it <hi>the way of Holineſs,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The way faring man, though a fool, shall not erre therein:</hi> It's the heartſomeſt way that can be; O! but it be ſafe for the way-faring ſinner, for the ſeriouſly ſeeking Soul, to have the face toward God, for making up of Peace

Nay (for this is not all) are ye thus in earneſt about Covenanting with God? which muſt preceed and go before, if things be right: It were good preparation, to have our very hearts moving and fluttering (as it were) within us to be at this.</p>

I ſhall hint at a few ſorts, that are not in earneſt. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such who are very ſerious to be at the externall ordinance of the Communion, and who will, it may be, take it ill, if they be keeped back from it, who yet never troubled themſelves, nor were ſeriouſly taken up with Covenanting with God, and with the ſtudy of Holineſs in all manner of Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or how to come by the enjoyment of his ſpeciall and gracious preſence: they can be year and day, nay many years, without it and never miſs it, not be troubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the want of it: Alace! It is not ſeriouſneſs to be at the Communion, without this, which will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit you; and even ye that are not admitted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are called to this. A <hi>Second</hi> Sort are ſuch, as are indifferent in all religious concerns; they care not for the Communion, and would not be very deſirous of it, if it were not a ſhame to them, and ſome reflection on them to be debarred from it; they think, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in Religion goeth beyond their Job, is but preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Niceneſs, Vanity, Conceit and Fancy; ſuch never knew what it was to be troubled with doubting or Tentations about their Souls ſtate, or the truth and reality of their Grace, nor what it was to be under any exerciſe of Conſcience on the account of much ſin and Guilt; nay they are glad and can boaſt themſelves that they were never under any ſuch ſerious exerciſe. A <hi>Third</hi> Sort is of ſuch, who are very civil in their carriage, but they have no more; &amp; if Heaven may be bad with Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies &amp; fair faſhions, they will be in it as ſoon as any; but they cannot endure to be at pains beyond their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to take hold of it, to do violence to ther own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to take the Kingdome of Heaven by force, nor in the leaſt to amend their Pace, &amp; to be Serious, come of it what may: Theſe are a dangerous company, they have

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tneſs of heart beſpeak a good frame and fit for Covenanting with God: Ah! where is it? The little heart-ſoftneſs that is amongſt us is one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the neck-breaks of Religion, and marrs our growth exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: what ſhall we ſay or think of our condition, when we call to remembrance the ſeekers of God of old, who watered their couches with tears and made their beds to ſwim: who mingled their drink with tears and their meat with weeping?

It is no wonder there be much lamenting for the want of ſenſe and life, when there is ſo much heart-hardneſs the contrarie of this heart melting ſoftneſs.</p>
            <p>But it may be <hi>Asked</hi> here: How comes it to paſs, that the People of God are now ſo unlike that which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:179825:130"/> Gods People were wont to be: ſo litle ſoftned, contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and melted? I ſpeak not of externall weeping and ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of tears: for there may be much of that, where the heart is but litle ſoftned, though not ordinarily: often when the heart is inwardly melted, externall weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſome Meaſure follows, though the one of theſe may be and is ſome times without the other: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I ſpeak of that ſoftneſs which is peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit for the Communion: but of that which is called for in our ordinary walk, to make us folding, yeelding, and pliable to God, ready to receive any impreſſion that he will pleaſe to ſtamp on us: what (I ſay) can be the cauſes of the want of this. Or that we are not in it as Gods people were wont to be? <hi>I anſwer Firſt,</hi> It may be, that Profeſſors now have much more conceit of their Profeſſion, and content themſelves better with the form, and with the Goſpels being clearer now then it was in former days; and <hi>God reſiſts the proud,</hi> yea even pride in the Godly: Trembling &amp; ſuch other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of tenderneſs in ſeverall of thoſe Saints mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture, are not much to be found with us, we are Alace! very unlike them; a ſharp word from God would have made the ſtrongeſt of them to tremble, nay the Godly are ſeveral times in the old Teſtament deſcri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ejudice: for the things of the world in a great meaſure got the upper hand of him, and that <hi>after the Lord had appeared to him twice:</hi> It were good and much to be wiſhed that many of you did eſpy this evil in your ſelves: the Scripture inſiſts much in it, as that which mens hearts are mainly carried out after: and yet we can get none almoſt convinced of it: Men will be got convinced of groſs out-breaking evils; but of this evil, the moſt earthly minded wormes cannot be gotten convinced: nay even good people are hardly got convinced of it: but ye are not in the leſs hazard of it: and we wot well, it's a plague in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that we live in, and hath much defaced Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to it's beauty, in the face of the Converſation of many: Ah! how much are they, in this, conformed to the word? And how Lamentably litle behave they like <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> in it, as the Saints did of old?</p>
            <p>As A <hi>Second Uſe</hi> of this point, We have ground here to <hi>Commend</hi> to you the ſtudie of a Soul-fixing &amp; faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition: as ye would not make an unſure bargain with God, endeavour to have this ſoftneſs and melting of heart: This thing is that which makes a <hi>man to ſit
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:179825:131"/> alone and to keep ſilence before God, Lam.</hi> 3.27. And ſo to be in a poſture of meeting and covenanting with him: ſuch of you as know nothing of this, and are not afraid of being hard, cold and dead at ſuch an occaſion, are in eminent hazard of loſing a good bargain: and wo to Security and hardneſs, that hath that as the fruit of it: and in the by we may ſay that there is a Wo abiding many of you, who have no Serious thoughts of this frame, and eſpecially at ſuch a time. Therefore let me <hi>Exhort</hi> you to compoſe your ſelves, as having to do with God, and as having Gods love and favour, and his hatred and wrath laid together in the ballance, and as having life and death ſet before you, and ſeriouſly to ſeek after ſuch a ſoft and tender frame of Soul that fits for Covenanting, for renewing the Covenant, and for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable communicating.</p>
            <p>But ſome may <hi>Object</hi> and ſay, It is very ſad, if this be peremptory, that perſons who would rightly renew their Covenant and Communicat, muſt be in a Soft and melting frame. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It's uſefull, and it's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nay in ſome meaſure it's Simply neceſſary: What ſhall we then do that want it? for <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I wiſh many were <hi>asking</hi> the queſtion from ſerious Minding, prizing and longing after the thing: for the want of Softneſs proceeds often from this, that we do not ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly mind it, otherwiſe, the want of it would much affect and afflict us, and would put us to ask after it, and God would not fail to give them direction that were thus <hi>asking the way to Zion.</hi> Yet for your help in this matter, I would ſay theſe <hi>three Words.</hi> 1. Once take a view of your caſe and labour to have a diſtinct look of it: what luſts are up, what challenges may be Tabled, and keep a good count of them. 2. Endeavour to have faith in Exerciſe on Gods Covenant and promiſes, and
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:179825:132"/> be ſure that the Promiſe is ſicker that ye lay hold on and ſee that ye make <hi>Uſe</hi> of it according to the Covenant: which is done, when with your Souls ye take hold of it: and that is not, nor ſhall not be reckoned preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Make this a particular errand to God, having your Eye on the Covenant of promiſes, and on this Promiſe in it in Particular, and on other promiſes of this Nature and to this purpoſe, as, concerning taking <hi>away the ſtonie heart and giving a heart of flesh: of giving you a new heart: of making you to loath your ſelves, for all your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations:</hi> apprehending, receiving and cloſing with Chriſt in the Covenant for attaining of it as a fruit of his purchaſe: for it is not gotten but in the Covenant: and therefore it's remarkable that this Scripture is ſet down Promiſe-wiſe, <hi>They shall come, the Children of Iſrael and the Children of Judah together: your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father</hi> who <hi>knows that ye have need of this thing</hi> (as it is <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.32.) <hi>will give his holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. And ye would credit and truſt him with the performing of that Promiſe to you: and endeavouring to be Serious in having this for your task and work, ye shal find it made good for you and to you.</p>

            <p>IT is a moſt deſirable deſigne and worthy to be driven vigourouſly by us all, to the proſecution whereof it would very well become us to ſtir up and rouze our ſelves and one another, according to the Laudable Practice of theſe here mentioned, even to haſten towards a cloſure of the Covenant of Grace betwixt God and us: to have it ſounding loud in our ears, and to have it as the Language of our hearts whetted to an edge in purſuit of the thing. <hi>Come, let us Joyn our ſelves to the Lord, in a perpetual Covenant that shall never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> It should be the great work and buſineſs of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Sabbath in a ſpeciall manner, as it is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed deſigne this day, to cloſe and make ſure this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and bleſſed bond betwixt the Lord and us.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken ſomewhat formerly at ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to theſe ſweet words. I ſhall not now trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou either with the diviſion or explication of them: but ſhall inſtantly propoſe <hi>Six</hi> or <hi>Seven Obſervations</hi> from them, and then ſpeak a word to the ſcope, and to the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of them, in the cloſe: and though it be but a ſhort word from each of them that we have to ſpeak; yet they will be found to be very Concerning to us, and therefore we would take the more exact notice of them.</p>
            <pb n="244" facs="tcp:179825:133"/>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Obſervation</hi> then is, that <hi>There is ſuch a thing as diſtinct Covenanting, or mutuall engaging in Covenant betwixt God and a poor ſinner.</hi> This is clearly holden out in theſe words as their Scope; It were to no Purpoſe for them to ſay, <hi>Come and let us Join our ſelves to the Lord in a Covenant,</hi> if there were not ſuch a thing as a Covenant union of God and ſinners. The Scripture is full to this Purpoſe, and the treatie of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances is kept up for this end; as we have it, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1, 2, 3. <hi>Ho every one that thirſts come to the waters, &amp;c. Incline your ear and come unto me, Hear and your Souls shall live, and I will make an everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> This is the Scope that the Ordinances aim at. In Proſecuting of this a little further, we ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Explicat what covenanting is, in generall. <hi>Secondly,</hi> What this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting with God is, 1. In reſpect of the parties. 2. In reſpect of the terms thereof. And 3. In reſpect of the ground on which it is founded. And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the form of this Covenanting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Covenanting in generall may be cleared, from what-Covenanting among men is: Which is a mutuall engaging of two parties on Mutuall terms; the one Party offering ſuch a thing on ſuch terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; the other partie accepting on thoſe terms and Conditions On which the offer is made: as we ſee in a contract of Marriage, the man engageth to be the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, on condition that ſhe be his, and ſhe engageth to be his wife; as he engageth to be her husband, and each engageth to perform ſuitable duties to the other; And we make uſe of this the rather that the Scripture alludeth to it in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to conſider Covenanting, as it is betwixt God and a ſinner: for we are not now ſpeaking
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:179825:133"/> of the Covenant of works betwixt God and <hi>Adam;</hi> wherein there was made an offer and Promiſe of life up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition of Perfect Obedience; So that if he did that which was Commanded him, he ſhould live, but we are now ſpeaking of Gods Covenanting with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for that is the Covenant ſpoken of here: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great wonder that ever there ſhould have been a Covenant betwixt God and a Creature; But a greater wonder that there ſhould be a Covenant betwixt him and a ſinfull creature: whatever is ſpoken in Scripture of the Covenant of Grace, belongs to this Covenant. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Parties</hi> in this Covenant are God and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Gods Creature, but a ſinfull creature; It's the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and we the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and we the houſe of <hi>Judah. Secondly, The terms</hi> of the Covenant are not, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> though the Promiſe be the ſame, for it's life that is offered; yet it's not on the ſame terms; for though the life be as good as that which was promiſed to <hi>Adam;</hi> yet the terms are far better: The ſubſtance of this Covenant we have ſet down, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.31, 32, 33. and cited <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. unto which this ſame invitation doth here relate; <hi>I will make a new Covenant with the houſe of Iſrael and with the houſe of Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers;</hi> But this ſhall be it, <hi>I will write my law in their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my People,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they here) <hi>and let us join in it:</hi> His engagement is to be their God, and their engagement is to be his people, and the terms fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; which are on Gods part, free forgiveneſs of ſins through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them, thorow whom they are accepted, as if there had never been a quarrel. And on their Part, by faith to take hold of him and of the Pardon of ſin, which ſeparated

                  </gap>o ning</hi> hath in it a ſpeciall <hi>Emphasis,</hi> being ſuch as is uſed to ſet out the conjunction that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Husband and Wife; <hi>for this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>shall a man leave Father and Mother and cleave to his wife,</hi> and ſo the wife cleaveth to her husband; Thus the word is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.34. <hi>Now shall my Husband be joined to me; therefore she called his name Levi,</hi> which flowes from this root, <hi>Added</hi> or <hi>Joined,</hi> In proſecuting this point a litle, we would ſpeak ſhortly, 1. To the nature of this Union. 2. To the properties of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to it's Nature, we would conſider, that there is. 1. A legall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein by contract and bond there is a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the intereſt of one Partie to another; which is here; for <hi>God</hi> becomes the ſinners God, and the ſinner becomes Gods own, as his portion and Property; Even as in marriage, the Husband
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:179825:136"/> is the wifes, and the wife is the Husbands, and the Relation ſtands, though they ſhould be in Severall Kingdomes. 2. There is a Myſticall union, which is ſpirituall and more Myſterious, wherbey God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh one with Covenanting ſinners, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with him; God by his Spirit dwelling in the Covenanter, and the Covenanter dwelling by faith in God: which floweth from the former mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually transferred right or legall union, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on it: In which reſpect it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17. <hi>He that is Joyned to the Lord is one ſpirit;</hi> He is <hi>Gods Temple,</hi> and <hi>God by his Spirit dwels in him:</hi> by this <hi>one ſpi it,</hi> is meant a Spirituall conjunction, Union or Communion whereby God takes hold really of the Soul by his Spirit, and the Soul takes a reall hold of God by Faith: they do mutually embrace each other, as the Husband doth the wife by vertue of their Union. 3. This Union implyeth a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a friendlineſs, an intimacy and familiarity, and it is oppoſed to diſtance and eſtrangement from God: The Covenant really entered into, is like a bond to keep the believer near God, glued (as it were) and ſtraitly join'd to him: or it is a cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, to ſpeak ſo: By this Covenant God and ſinners are made near and knit to one another and kept from ever Separating: There is ſuch a near and ſtrait Union betwixt Chriſt and Believers, as is betwixt the foundation or corner-ſtone and the houſe, yea as is betwixt the vine and the branches, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>John</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Properties of this Union by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:179825:136"/> Covenant, a few of which we ſhall only now touch at, not having acceſs to inlarge, as this Subject by it ſelf, would require. 1. It is with the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not with any benefit, common gift or Grace or Mercie, theſe fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>low the union with himſelf, the Covenanter becomes <hi>one Spirit with him</hi> (as is ſaid,) and ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <hi>we are flesh of his fl sh and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> 2. This Union is in and through Chriſt, by whom it is made up: he being the Temple and Tabernacle or meeting place wherein we meet with God: So that we are not anxiouſly to enquire, nor curiouſly to diſpute here, how our union with God, and with the Mediator do differ: we unite with God in him, and upon the Grounds of his Redemption, in which reſpect, our union with God is more Mediat. 3. This Union is very friendly, moſt firm and indiſſoluble: It's a wonderfull near and ſure Union. It is an inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible union, and therefore we muſt here give over ſpeaking further to it, only looking to a word of it, <hi>John</hi> 17.21, 23. in the 21. <hi>verſ.</hi> ſaith our Lord: <hi>That they all may be one, as thou father art in me and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us:</hi> It's ſuch an union by the Believers being in God and in the Mediator, as is that, whereby God and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator are one, though no parity is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but a reſemblance only: and <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>I in them and thou in me, that they may be made Perfect in one: I in them,</hi> here the union is moſt Immediat: <hi>and thou in me,</hi> there the Union is more mediat, <hi>viz.</hi> by Gods being in the Mediator dwelling in the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:179825:137"/> Believer, and the Believers dwelling in God, (the fulneſs of the God-head being in the mediator) by his meeting with God through faith in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: and indeed, were there no more but this, It ſaith that this Covenant is a good bargain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third Obſervation</hi> is, that <hi>Union with the Lord by this Covenant is accesſible to a run-away Sinner, that hath perverted his way, upon his coming aright to cloſe with him therein on the terms of it.</hi> Who are thoſe coming here to Join in Covenant with the Lord? It is, even thoſe ſpoken of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Back-ſliding Children, Treacherous dealers,</hi> who are bidden <hi>return, and he will heal their back-ſlidings:</hi> which could not be, if this Covenant were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible to ſinners: nay let me ſay, there is ſcarce any ſort of ſin, but the Lord out faceth it in his Covenant, as we may ſee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot with many lovers, thou haſt ſpoken a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d one evil as thou could'ſt;</hi> yet <hi>wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, my Father?</hi> If we look to the groſneſs of ſin, were it like <hi>Scarlet</hi> or <hi>Crimſon, Iſaiah</hi> 1.18. <hi>It shall be made white like Snow and wooll: if ye be willing and obedient,</hi> ſaith the Lord, to cloſe a Covenant with me, <hi>ye shall eat the good of the Land.</hi> In the propounding of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he will take away that exception of the groſneſs of ſin, which might ſtand in the ſinners way, were it even rotten Hypocriſy, deteſtable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency and luk-warmneſs in the matters of God, putting the Perſon in hazard to be ſpewed out of Chriſts Mouth, yet he ſaith even to ſuch (if they will indeed take his counſell, and be content to have
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:179825:137"/> their deadly evils removed and their wants ſupplied) <hi>I counſel thee to come and buy of me Eye-ſalve, Gold, and Garments:</hi> and <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, if any man will open the door, I will come in to him and Sup with him and he with me.</hi> Only take this word of Advertiſment here, and then I ſhall clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Doctrine further: when then we ſpeak of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners acceſs to God by this Covenant, we mean, that there is acceſs, only on Condition they take with their faults and come weeping, heart-broken and ſomeway ſuitably affected with their ſin; theſe only are the perſons that may comfortably expect this acceſſe, he ſeeks after ſuch, though he will find none ſuch till he make them ſuch. For further clearing and confirming of it then, we would conſider theſe <hi>Four</hi> things. 1. Gods end in the Covenant, which will make out this, that there muſt be acceſs to a run-away ſinner by this Covenant to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, when he comes home to him in the way of Repentance and Believing; becauſe his end in the Covenant is <hi>to ſave Sinners,</hi> often ſpoken of; to <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ungodly, Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To dwell with Rebels, Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>To get a Name and a Praiſe to himſelf</hi> of being gracious: as it cannot admit of, nor let in a ſinner, but on this Condition; So it cannot but accept of a ſinner having this condition. 2. We would conſider Gods contrivance of the covenant in making it ſuitable to ſuch an end, ſo as it may make the Riches of his Grace to ſhine, and may be effectuall for the gaining of Souls; and therefore, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. It is ſaid in this reſpect, to be <hi>ordered in all things and ſure:</hi> and <hi>Jere.</hi> 31.33. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. The ſubſtance of it is ſet down compended in a few words, <hi>I will Pardon their iniquity and remember their ſin no more,</hi> &amp;c. 3. We would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the adminiſtration of the Covenant; It's not in an
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:179825:138"/> immediat way, as that firſt Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> was, wherein there was no mediator, neither was there need of any; but it is in a mediat way by a ſuretie and Mediator, who hath taken on and engaged for the debt of the Covenanting ſinner, and hath under taken for his thorow-bearing: now why is this adminiſtration and diſpenſation? But becauſe the Principall debtor is a bankerout and not able to Satisfie for himſelf; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath acceſs to come and get Pardon, and to be friends with God thorow the Mediator. 4. We would conſider all the Properties of the Covenant, eſpecially the freeneſs of it, and we will find that they ſpeak out this; It's a Covenant of <hi>Sure Mercies, Iſaiah</hi> 55.3. And all the Promiſes and Articles of it reſpect ſinners, and hold forth this, that there is a way laid down, how a ſinner at feud with God, may get this Union made up by Covenanting wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth Obſervation</hi> is, that <hi>Covenanting with God is a very short cut for the quieting, peace, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a treacherous back ſliding ſinner:</hi> Therefore, when theſe People here ſpoken of are, in their Holy heat and warmneſs, ſtirred up under the conviction and ſenſe of their guilt: as the ſhort cut to come to peace and a happy condition, they ſay, <hi>Come and let us Joyn our ſelves to the Lord in a Perpetuall Covenant.</hi> It's the accepting of Gods offer, and being content to be his on the account of Chriſts righteouſneſs, that they Propoſe to themſelves as the ground of their calme, quietneſs, and happineſs. This <hi>Obſervation</hi> implies theſe <hi>Three</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Covenanting with God, doth fully make the Covenanter happie, though formerly he hath been a miſerable ſinner; and O! This is a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that makes a ſinner compleatly happy: It makes him to ſay, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:179825:138"/> is none upon the earth that I deſire beſide thee: Pſal.</hi> 73. I ſhall name a few Scriptures to ſhew the full happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſinner that enters in this Covenant: The <hi>firſt</hi> whereof is, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant well ordered in all things and ſure, and this is all my Salvation, and all my deſire:</hi> It's <hi>menſura Voti,</hi> even all that heart can wiſh: and theſe words being conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>David the ſweet ſinger of Iſrael</hi> his laſt words, when he is a dieing, they clearly imply a commendation of this Covenant as full for the happineſs of a ſinner. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother paſſage is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.7. <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things:</hi> How is that? even thus: <hi>I will be his God and he shall be my Son,</hi> that is, in ſubſtance; I will declare my ſelf to be in Covenant with him, This is the compend of the compleat happineſs of Glorified Saints in heaven, and the begun happineſs of Believers, of Sojourning Saints here on earth, in a leſs meaſure and lower degree; for in Heaven God <hi>will be all and in all:</hi> and is not this a good bargain, &amp; good to ſinners? which commends it the more. A <hi>Third</hi> Place is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Where it's told us, that nothing can be <hi>laid to their Charge,</hi> But it's anſwered in this Covenant. They have a Cautioner to pay their debt, and to ſtrengthen them for their dutie: <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be their God and they shal be my People: I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me: I will pardon their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> all bygones, <hi>and heal their back-ſlidings,</hi> they ſhall not get leave to go from me: would ye be pliable and yeelding to Gods Covenant; <hi>I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts, and a new heart will I give unto them, and will cauſe them to walk in my Statuts and to do them. Secondly,</hi> The Doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, as it is a full Covenant, or makes the Covenanter
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:179825:139"/> fully happy: So it makes him ſickerly &amp; ſurely happy: 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.5. <hi>It's a Covenant well ordered in all things and ſure,</hi> who ever by Faith betake themſelves to Chriſts righteouſneſs, and lay hold on this Covenant, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Communion with God as certainly as <hi>Adam</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall had it for it's the ſame God that promiſeth who is as faithfull as ever he was: Hence it is called <hi>a word tryed as ſilver in a furnace ſeven times, a pure</hi> word that cometh out of the furnace alwayes as maſſie and weighty as it went in: and the ground of the Covenant being Chriſts ſatisfaction, it makes it Sure. Therefore he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s called a <hi>tryed Corner ſtone,</hi> a <hi>ſure foundation. Thirdly,</hi> It implies, that, as it is a Sure, So it is a compendious and ſpeedy way to happineſs &amp; of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Sinner, which maketh much for Gods praiſe: He is a <hi>very preſent help in time of trouble,</hi> or <hi>a ſpeedy help, Pſal.</hi> 46. So, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith <hi>Dav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d) I would confeſs my trangresſion, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin:</hi> Immediatly (as if he had ſaid) upon my confeſſion, without longer delay: and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7. This <hi>Pſalm</hi> is made uſe of, to demonſtrat the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth Obſervation</hi> is, That <hi>ſinners who are lying under a quarrel with God and have the offer of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, should betake themſelves to it, and without delay p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t a cloſe to the bargain betwixt God and them. Come</hi> (ſay they here) <hi>and let us join our ſelves to the Lord, in a perpetuall Covenant,</hi> whereby is holden out, that when a ſinner hath acceſs to the Covenant with God, he ſhould flee to it &amp; take hold of it quickly. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, covenanting with God is compared to <hi>fleeing in to the City of Refuge, Heb.</hi> 6. That which I mean, is <hi>firſt,</hi> that a ſinner, who hath this <hi>Covenant</hi> in his offer, ſhould take no other way for Juſtification and freedom from
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:179825:139"/> ſin and wrath, but hold to this only and ſeek to be Juſtified by it. 2. That he ſhould do it ſpeedily: when the word of the Goſpel ſaith <hi>Come,</hi> he ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Lo I come unto thee;</hi> when God by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel maketh a gracious declaration, that he will accept of loſt ſinners that come to him, and ſaith, <hi>This is the day of Salvation, this is the accepted time;</hi> as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. and when by his miniſters he waiteth on you, inviteth and wooeth you, ye ſhould preſently, without delay or demurr, cloſe with the offer and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the invitation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſixth Obſervation</hi> is, that <hi>Thoſe who are convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they have ſinned and would fain be in Covenant with God, should endeavour to have it throughed and made ſure, to have it an abſolutely cloſed and ended bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> This is very clear in this peoples practice, who concernedly ſay, <hi>Come let us Join our ſelves in a perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall Covenant never to be forgotten,</hi> they think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get it made ſure enough, and therefore they joyn, <hi>never to be forgotten,</hi> to <hi>perpetuall,</hi> they Judged that it could not Poſſibly be made too ſure: which manifeſtly ſaith, that when God giveth an opportunity to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to or renew a Covenant with him, we ſhould be Holily ſolicitous, in very good earneſt, and greatly concerned to have it made ſicker, as the words is, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt, <hi>We make a ſure Covenant and write it, and our Princes Levits and Prieſts Seal unto it,</hi> that word <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 44.5. Is remarkable to this Purpoſe, <hi>One shall ſay, I am the Lords, and an other shall call himſelf by the name of</hi> Jacob; <hi>and another shall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord;</hi> That it might ſtand (as it were) over his head, as being formally and explicitly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, with heart and hand: and they that know how fickle and inconſtant their hearts are: and how prone to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:179825:140"/> deal looſely and unfaithfully in Gods Covenant, have good reaſon to look to this, that all be ſure work; that they get not the ſhell for the Kernell, and go not down to the grave with a lie in their right hand.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh Obſervation</hi> is, That <hi>There are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beſide other times, wherein ſome People beſide others have it pungently Put to them to enter in, and to renew their Covenant with God.</hi> Theſe here ſpoken of, who ſay (having Gods preſſing call to it, before they ſaid it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h God is wrought in them; or when their own frame, through Grace, Preſſeth them on to it; as we may ſee it did in this People. 3. When the Lord o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Puts People to it; and more eſpecially in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; the very fight and offer of the elements in the Communion ſpeak plainly, on the matter, to the Communicants, are ye indeed in earneſt in the great buſineſs of covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God; Since ye are now to receive the Seal of it? If ye be not, ye notably Profane the Ordinance, by
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:179825:140"/> ſetting a Seal to a blank charter: It is therefore called the <hi>Covenant; This is the Cup of the New Covenant:</hi> Becauſe it puts you in mind of the Covenant, and puts you to it, whether ye will really engage in it: It is like the Kings appointing a day for ſealing of Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dons to Rebels; his Proclamation <hi>firſt</hi> Puts them to it, to accept of the Pardon; <hi>Next</hi> the heraulds put them to it: and then <hi>Laſtly</hi> the ſet and fixed time or day of the ſealing, puts them Moſt of all to it: and ſo it is with you in this Ordinance, that we are by and by to be about.</p>
            <p>We come now to the <hi>Application</hi> of all, wherein we ſhall not inſiſt on all things that theſe <hi>Doctrines</hi> Miniſter ground for: but ſhall Pitch on ſome moſt Uſefull, and which are the great Scope of the Text and of the day.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, I would <hi>Beſeech</hi> you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to gather and compoſe Your ſelves, and grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ponder what it is, that this day ye are Preſſingly called to; It is even this, <hi>Come and let us Join our ſelves to the Lord in a Perpetual Covenant, never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</hi> Know and Believe, that there is ſuch a thing as Covenanting with God; That God is dealing with you to Covenant with him; and that it is a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: <hi>To you is this word of Salvation ſent:</hi> And ye ſhould be very Seriouſly thinking how to get it accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made uſe of; how to receive this offer by Faith, and how to get your ſelves given up and awa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to him; becauſe in this Covenant (as I ſhewed before) there is a Mutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h the offer, and give up our ſelves to him to be at his diſpoſe: have ye any ſerious thoughts of this? But your ſelves to it, and we
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:179825:141"/> in the Name of the Lord put you to it, for we cannot well proceed any further, till ye be at ſome point in this: are ye in earneſt? Is this your errand in being here to day? If not, why are ye come hither? Is it to ſee how the day goeth, or is it only to get your Communion, as ye uſe to ſpeak? Alace! what's that? It's to Covenant with God, and ere ye depart this Place, to put it to a point, that it may be a cloſed bargain, that ſhould be your errand.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the <hi>Second</hi> Place we <hi>tell</hi> you, that the great God is content to Covenant with poor, fectleſs and ſinfull C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eatures, whereat ye may wonder, and ſay, Is it ſo <hi>in very deed that God will dwell with men on earth?</hi> Will he indeed Covenant with men, with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, with Treacherous dealing men, with back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders? Yea we tell you, that it is ſo; he is content to be your God, and that ye poſſeſs all things in him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pardon you all your ſins, to give you Grace and Glory, even every good thing: to enter you heirs to a Kingdome, and on good and eaſie terms: to do it freely <hi>without Money, and without Price,</hi> If ye be but indeed content to accept of His offer on his eaſie and very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms: and may not your very hearts laugh within you at the hearing of the glad tydings of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and that God is yet content to make it up with you? O how ſappie and Maſſie is this! and that is a very ſweet word to this Purpoſe which we have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leaſt, real Covenanting and union with God, and the Believer hath a right to this and all things: He hath here an offer and another ſort of right, then he hath to his houſe and land or cloths, it's aright to God, that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:179825:141"/> giveth a right to theſe things, I mean a Spirituall right: for we ſpeak not now of that which is civill: let us, therefore, ſtay our ſelves and wonder, and be ſtirred and affected with it, that the infinit and alſufficient God is content to make this good bargain, and even now to make it with us Sinners, even with inſignificant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We make <hi>Proclamation</hi> of this bargain to you, and avouch, that there is Salvation offered to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to be had through Jeſus Chriſt: the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth and warranteth us to make this Proclamation, as well as he did <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> when he ſaith to him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Go and Proclaim theſe words towards the North, return thou back-ſliding Iſrael, and I will not cauſe mine anger to fall upon thee, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever:</hi> He alloweth, nay he Peremptorily Commandeth that ye ſhould be put to it: and therefore when we have laid the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you: what ſay ye to it, what will ye do? We muſt have an anſwer from you: ye have his word and Oath for confirmation of it: O Believe and take hold of it, and ye ſhall get the ſeal from us as his Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; who treat with you, according to our Commiſſion, in his Name; And here we muſt be particular, and be ye particular with your ſelves: take and receive what we ſay to you with a warrant, as the word of the Lord, for it is no leſs his Word now, then it was when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and the other Prophets ſpoke it, when the Apoſtles ſpoke it, yea When Chriſt ſpake it himſelf: It's the ſame Covenant and the ſame word, that this day is preached to you; The Lord cals us to ſtir up our ſelves, and to ſay in good earneſt, <hi>Come let us joyn our ſelves to him in a Perpetuall Covenant,</hi> 1. The party inviting is the Lord Jehovah in the Mediator, and ſure he is a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:179825:142"/> moſt, yea <hi>the</hi> moſt excellent Party; <hi>thy maker</hi> (ſaith he <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.8.) <hi>is thy Husband.</hi> 2. There are in this Covenant excellent Promiſes: God is content to be your God and to take you for his people and Spouſe, to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don your iniquity, to heal your back-ſlidings, to Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and ſave you, and to make you eternally happy: and are not theſe deſirable? 3. It calls you to give your ſelves up to him: and indeed it is very reaſonable, that if the husband give himſelf to the wife, ſhe ſhould give her ſelf to him. Are ye then content to treat with God in the Mediator, and to be his on his own terms? It is good to meet and treat with God in him. Have ye any ground to except againſt this? Doth it pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe you? ſay to it, tell your mind? For I declare to you, that if ye get him to be yours, you muſt needs be his. I fear many of you ſtand and ſtick at this, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the high reaſonableneſs of it: is this, think ye, an evil, diſadvantagious, or Prejudicial exchange? whether is it better that the one and only true God reign over you, then that Sathan and a multitude of ſtrange Lords, your Luſts, taking the Throne (as it were) by turns, ſhould reigne over you? It's both ſad and ſtupendious, that ever this ſhould be ſuffered once to come in queſtion or debate; and yet, Alace! it's this, or ſome thing like this, at which it will ſtand: either ye will not take God for your God: or ye will not give your ſelves to him to be his People, on his own very reaſonable and eaſie terms? and I trow, ye will make no better. I would, therefore, yet again put you to it: for it's the very thing that ye are called to, the great buſineſs of the day, and it's come even to the ſhock.</p>
            <p>And therefore, labour to be at a point, whether ye will cloſe with him or not: If ye will ſincerely ſay, we
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:179825:142"/> take the Lord to be our God, and give our ſelves to him, to be his People and ſervants: then we ſay to you, and aſſure you in his Name, that this Cup, that by and by ye are to drink, ſhall be according to his warrant, <hi>The new Covenant in his Blood.</hi> And to preſs you to the thing, let me but <hi>Ask</hi> you a few <hi>Queſtions.</hi> 1. Is there not need of Covenanting with God? Are there not many ſins on your ſcore? Is there not a quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and you? Is not this bargain meet and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you, which holds out remiſſion of ſins and peace with God? are ye not urgently called to it? And what ground of challenge will it be, think ye, that this was in your offer, and on very free and eaſie terms, and ye would not accept of it, but would needs deſtroy your ſelves? 2. If there be ſin and a quarrell, is there not a neceſſity to have it taken away? Have ye laid your account and reſolved not to be ſolicitous and carefull, whether ye be friends with God or not? And if ye will not ſay that, why do ye not enter this Covenant? 3. Is there any other way to get ſin pardoned and the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell taken away, but by making ſure your Covenant with God? <hi>David</hi> or any others that were ſaved, were they ſaved any other way? This Covenant was <hi>all his Salvation and all his deſire.</hi> 4. What will ye ſay in the day of the Lord, when the Trumpet ſhall ſound, and he ſhall call you to an account for refuſing his free and Gracious offer; when there will be no more treating with you, when he ſhall ſay, and make your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſay to you? It was plainly told you, that there was a quarrell ſtanding betwixt me, and you; It was told you, that I was willing to enter into a Covenant with you, and to remove that quartell, I ſent my Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers unto you for this end, but ye made light of the matter: Say to it, O ſay to it; ye muſt ſay ſomething,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:179825:143"/> 
               <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay;</hi> ye are not left to be indifferent and to keep up your ſelves in this matter; I tell you if ye ſay not <hi>Yea,</hi> ye ſay <hi>Nay;</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 46. Ye paſs ſentence on your ſelves, <hi>and judge your ſelves unworthy of Eternall life:</hi> It's interpretatively a ſaying, that ye will not have Heaven and life thorow Chriſt: and therefore, as ye would not deſtroy your own Souls, I beſeech you, nay I obteſt you in the Name of the Lord and for his ſake; accept of this Covenant. We tell you and as the Apoſtle hath it, we ſay, <hi>Be it known unto you, that through Jeſus Chriſt remisſion of ſins is Preached to you:</hi> He hath purchaſed life and Salvation to ſinners, And <hi>to you is the word of this Salvation ſent:</hi> Give, O give your conſent to the bargain, and that is all we ſeek of you.</p>
            <p>Now to Proſecute this a little, and to put you yet further to it, becauſe it will ly before God, whether we have put you to it or not, and whether ye have accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Covenant or not: whether we were in earneſt in Propoſing it, and whether ye were in earneſt in cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it: Conſider, 1. The Perſons whom we put to this, and the things that we put you to. 2. The terms on which, 3. The grounds from which, and. 4. The qualifications and directions whereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As for the perſons whom we put and preſs to this Covenanting with God: It's not thoſe only who have gotten their tokens warranting them to come to the Table, nor thoſe only that are debarred and ſo have got no tokens: but it's all of you, <hi>Thoſe who are afar off and near hand:</hi> but differently: To the tender Soul, we ſay, come forward: to the ſecure we ſay, Humble your ſelves and then come and join in this Covenant. The thing we call you to, is to take the Lord to be your God, and to give up your ſelves to be Gods, we call
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:179825:143"/> you to take God to be your Maſter, and your Father, your Saviour, your Head, your Husband, your Friend, even your all, and that is no ill nor ſmall offer: and we call you to give up your ſelves to God, to forſake your Fathers houſe, and all your kindred and to cleave to him: <hi>to join your ſelves to the Lord,</hi> as the Text hath it: and as it is ſaid, <hi>The Prodigall Joyned himſelf to a certain Citizen,</hi> So ye would joyn your ſelves to the Lord, and be beholden to him for your life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the Terms, they are in ſhort: that Seeing God ſaith, accept of my Sons Righteouſneſs, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters: ye would freely accept of it, and take and put Chriſts Righteouſneſs in the place and Room of ſelf-righteouſneſs which was in the Covenant of works: found your plea before God on nothing that ye can do, but on Chriſts doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for you, which now by Faith ye reſolve to adhere to, and reſigne your ſelves to him without any reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be guided and ſaved by him, in his own way.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Third,</hi> How, or from and by what grounds we put you to this: or rather how doth the Lord put us all to it? <hi>Firſt,</hi> Ye are put to it by his offer in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: which, in diſcretion, cals you to give him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; he cries, <hi>Come unto me, and I will make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> And doth he not require an anſwer? And is it not incumbent to us who ſpeak to you in his Name, to crave your anſwer? We declare to you all, that ye may if ye will, come to be joined with God in Covenant, and may be ſure to be accepted of as his, if ye come aright; Now, what ſay ye to it? either ye muſt look on this as a cheat or cunningly deviſed fable, or if ye dare not look on it ſo, ye muſt accept of it and make it welcome. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye are put to it, in this reſpect, that the Lord
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:179825:144"/> brings you now and then under ſome conviction of the neceſſity of your peace with God; ſomething within you ſaith, that peace with God is worth the having and needfull, that this is a good bargain, and that ye have need of it, and there are now and then ſome raw reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to put it to a point; and it may be there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preſently that puts you to it; and if not, ſo much the more ye would put your ſelves to it; leſt <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God be taken from you. Thirdly,</hi> Ye are put to it by this ſame Sacrament; is it poſſible that ye can take the Communion for a Seal and confirmation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye Covenant with God before; If ye will not Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, ye prove your ſelves to be Treacherous diſſembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in going to the Communion, and to be liars to God; when he preſents and offers his Covenant: ye profeſs to take his offer and to cloſe the Covenant with him, but ye refuſe, as it were, to take the Pen in your hand, or do throw it away: when he preſents to you the Cup of the New Teſtament, ye drink the Wine and ſpill the Blood, and ſo become <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord,</hi> when ye deſpiſe it, and will not make uſe of it, nor Covenant with God that ye may get the uſe of it. And therefore, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Know, that ye are put to it preſently and peremptorily, &amp; that the Lord will take it for a refuſall and for a ſcorning and deſpiſing on your part, if ye do it not; and do ye think it a litle matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie; take all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſubmit your ſelves intirely to him in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. 3. As to the time, ye muſt do all this preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for the Lord doth not allow us to give you an hour, or to promiſe to treat with you one hour after this; It's now, <hi>come and let us join our ſelves to the Lord;</hi> It's no difficult thing that ye are called to; It's <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with the heart, and to confeſs with the mouth our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. The Object is Chriſt: the Condition is Faith, whereby he is griped and taken hold of, and which goeth out towards him in the word: And ſo ye have no more ado, but when the offer and Promiſe comes out, to accept and ſubſcribe, and to ſay, <hi>I am the Lords, I will be his, to be ſaved by his Righteouſneſs and made Holy by his Grace,</hi> both which are contained in the Covenant; I am content to be beholden to him both for Holineſs and happineſs; and it ſhall be a bargain. The Lord himſelf perſwade you to do ſo, and that preſently without delaying, dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, or ſhifting and off putting.</p>
            <p>Now it may be, that ſome think this to be a good bargain, but they know not how to make it ſure and ſiker, ſo as it may hold for ever.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to forget the Covenant, in Scripture, is to deal falſly in it, and to forget the Covenant and to break it, are the ſame. 2. Becauſe it is (as we take it) oppoſed to their fear of falſe dealing in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: as if they had ſaid, we were once in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, but we did deal falſly in it and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>get it: Let us now therefore <hi>Join our ſelves in a per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petual Covenant never to be forgotten,</hi> Let it be a conſtant and ſtanding, a laſting, even an everlaſting bargain.</p>

This is ſadly verified in the experience of many common profeſſors of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and often even of the Godly themſelves in a meaſure; Even now there will be a bargaining with God, and within a litle they will forget it: <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though all should forſake thee, yet will not I,</hi> And yet within a very litle he is found ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that ſame night denies and forſwears his

But I think this is beyond any need of Proof; we rather ſtand in need to have the impreſſion of it made deep upon our hearts; and to go from the work we have been about with Holy fear and jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſie over our ſelves, beſpeaking our ſelves thus, what if this engagement, we have come under, hold not, but prove like <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſince ye have ſo many and clear proofs of the truth of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:179825:149"/> in your own ſad experience, is there not the greater need of Holy fear and watchfulneſs?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Obſervation</hi> is, That, <hi>Thoſe who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Serious in Covenanting with God, will be no leſs ſo, in keeping of and ſtanding to it.</hi> Where People are ſound and Honeſt at the heart, it will be no leſs an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking work to them, how to keep Covenant, then it was to get it entered in; Therefore theſe here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned have it as one peece of their Seriouſly uptaking buſineſs, how to be joined to the Lord in Covenant; and another, how to get it ſtood to, ſo as it may be a perpetual one never to be forgotten: the Same reaſons that prove that there ſhould be, or that there is Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in making &amp; cloſing the Covenant, will alſo prove that there ſhould be, and will be ſeriouſneſs in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to keep it; for if the Perſon honeſtly mind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Bleſſings Covenanted, he muſt and will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep and ſtand to the Covenant; If he honeſtly mind and ſincerely deſire to be in good terms with God through the Covenant, he muſt and will endeavour to ſtand to the Terms of the Covenant, and breach of Covenant will waken a Challenge. If it be a Principle of true ſaving Grace that puts a perſon to deſire to be under the bond of Gods Covenant; that ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will make him deſire and endeavour to abide under that bond, and to keep faithfully to him; Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29.30. <hi>I have choſen the way of thy precepts; and I have ſtuck unto thy teſtimonies:</hi> There is a chooſing of the Covenant and Teſtimonies, and a deſigne of ſticking to them, when upon choice cloſed with.</p>

The Apoſtle <hi>James Chap.</hi> 1. Speaks of two ſorts of men that are bearers of the word, and be compares the one ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> Forgetfull hearers, to a man, <hi>Who beholding his naturall face in a glaſs, goes away, and ſtraightway forgets what manner of man he was;</hi> but the other ſort are ſuch, <hi>Who are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hfull in Gods Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now would ye know, wherein this Seriouſneſs in keeping and Performing Covenant conſiſts. Ye may
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:179825:150"/> take it in theſe Characters. The man that is Serious in performing his engagement, 1. His heart is taken up with it, and there is an ardent longing to be anſwerable to the Covenant that he is entered into with God; His greateſt wiſh in all the world is, as to be in it, ſo to be faithfull in keeping it; therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.5. <hi>O that my wayes were directed to keep thy ſtatuts;</hi> and this is given as a mark of <hi>the Bleſſed man who is undefiled in the way:</hi> and ſaith he verſ. 6. <hi>Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments;</hi> which is a reaſon of the former, and a confirmation of it; he deſignes to be ſhort in his obedience to no command, and he does not allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his ſhort-coming even as to degree, but is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in purſuing his deſigne <hi>always even unto the end.</hi> 2. Seriouſneſs in performing appeareth, by kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the impreſſion of the weightineſs of the eye and obligation that the Covenant lays on Perſons; it ſomeway affects and burdens them, ſo that they walk not ſo lightly as others do under the obligation &amp; debt of the Covenant; though it be a friendly debt, and alſo a Priviledge: Their burden is not, that they are under the obligation, but how to get it performed, thus ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Thy vows are upon me, O God:</hi> they take on vows to God, and keep them on, and walk, as being under them: this is a main thing to be looked to in keeping Covenant. 3. This ſeriouſneſs in performing, appears in the fear that perſons have of going wrong and Miſ-carrying; they are afraid to break to God: neither are any ſo ſuſpicious of them, as they are of themſelves, knowing by ſad experience, that their <hi>hearts are deceitful above all things:</hi> and this is a very native evidence, conſidering what we heard of our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſs, which cannot be without the impreſſion of fear.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:179825:151"/> 4. It appears in a Holy carefulneſs and diligence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that which they fear: leſt at any time they let a buckle ſlip (to ſpeak ſo) and leſt that which they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed come on them, their fear puts them to diligence to prevent the thing feared: This makes them to faſt and Pray, and to be watchfull over themſelves in looſe and untender company, and to eſchew them as far as they can, and to hazard ſome loſs, rather then to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under a ſnare; watching and praying leſt they fall into the ſin of dealing falſely in Gods Covenant. 5. It appears in the ſharpneſs of challenges, when any thing miſcarries in their hand: They are ſoon challenged for the very firſt beginnings of a breach: a wrong look will affect them: therefore faith <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 31. <hi>I made a covenant with my eyes, why then should I look upon a maid?</hi> And the heart, while tender, will loath and ſcare at the leaſt thing that hath the remoteſt tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a breach, were it but the appearance of evill: Any the leaſt guilt ſoon toucheth and ſmiteth them, not only that which is their own, but even that of others: Thus good <hi>Ezra</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Should we again break thy Commandments, and Joyn in affinity with the People of theſe Abominations?</hi> And he lyeth in the duſt before God mourning, becauſe of this. 6. It appears in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the exerciſe of a perſons Faith: as It's an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking work and buſineſs to honeſt Souls, to get their Faith founded rightly in cloſing the Covenant with God, that they be well grounded in believing: So it is no leſs an uptaking and exerciſing work, to be improving their faith on Gods Promiſes, to make them forth-coming according to their engagement and for keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It may be, for as many Profeſſed Covenanters as are here, that but few of you know much, if any thing at all, what it is to be taken up with being Anſwerable to the Covenant according to your engagements: this, no doubt, makes much unſound work, that ye do not ſingly and ſeriouſly deſigne this: that ye reach not forward, that ye bear not down the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is an evil readily incident to many Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Religion, that they would fain be at marks of a good Spirituall ſtate and of being in Covenant with God, but ſuch as would not diſturb their carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, eaſe, and lazineſs, nor put them on to painful diligence: but we have no ſuch marks to give: neither dare we for the fear of God, and becauſe of the hazard of Souls, aſſigne any ſuch; there being none ſuch given or aſſigned in the word of God: nay let me tell you, that if there be not Painfull diligence and Faithfulneſs in keeping Covenant with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, it will darken the light of any other mark that can be given; and no doubt, it's this negligence and unfaithfulneſs that makes many good marks, clear in themſelves, dark to many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, while they give not diligence to make their
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:179825:152"/> calling and election ſure, and give not all diligence to add one Grace to another, and one degree of Grace to another: It is alſo the cauſe of uncomfortable walking, yea of uncomfortable Communicating: but to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere &amp; ſerious in owning our Covenant-engagements, and faithfully forth-coming in the Fruits thereof, and in a cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eſpondent converſation, is a mark that will give comfort, and ſome quietneſs at leaſt, till Comfort come: the Lord will comfortably confeſs ſuch as faithfully confeſs him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Obſervation</hi> is, that <hi>It is and will be the great ſtudy of Perſons really entered in Covenant with God, to have it an abiding bargain, a perpetuall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant never to be forgotten:</hi> This is their deſigne as well as their duty, that their Practice and walk may be ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Covenant. And it being the main thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the words, and that which we intend to inſiſt on: I ſhall in the proſecution of it, ſpeak a litle to theſe <hi>three.</hi> 1. To what it is to aim to have Gods Covenant perpetual, and never to be forgotten. 2. To the reaſons and the ground that there is to preſs this. And 3. To ſome motives and encouragements for exciting to it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt, viz.</hi> What it is to ſtudy to have Gods Covenant Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>petuall and never to be forgotten? We take it up in theſe particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That thoſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Covenant would drive the great deſigne of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; which it Summed in theſe <hi>Two</hi> words, To have God to be ours, and our ſelves to be Gods; It's even that which we have in Anſwer to the firſt queſtion of our excellent <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> What is Mans chief end? To enjoy God, and to glorifie him; to enjoy him as our own God, and to glorifie him, by acknowledging our ſelves to be his, and by devoring our ſelves to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as being a People <hi>formed for himſelf, to shew forth
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:179825:152"/> his praiſe;</hi> This ſhould be vigorouſly driven, as the great deſigne of the Covenanter with G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; and it would be a notable help to keep Covenant: even to live and walk, So as we may have Gods Company: for what <hi>Uſe</hi> ſerves Gods Covenant unto us, and our entering therein, if we continue as great ſtrangers to him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? If this be not driven as our deſigne, we forget wherefore we Covenanted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There would be a minding of our own obligation in the Covenant, as the condition or mean by which the end, <hi>viz.</hi> The enjoying of God, is come at; which is in a word, to be his, to walk before him, as he willeth <hi>Abraham</hi> to do. <hi>Walk before me and be thou Perfect,</hi> God himſelf is that which the Covenanter ſhould Principally aim at; &amp; walking before him is the mean appointed for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that end; in ſhort, what ever the Covenant ſaith in reference to our duty; as to abandon Luſts, <hi>To be Holy in all manner of Converſation: to be watchful: to glorifie God in our Bodies and Spirits which are his,</hi> &amp;c. Is that which we are tyed to in the Covenant, and which we would ſeriouſly drive at as our great deſigne. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There be a minding and remembring of Gods engagement to us in the Covenant, which is a part of it, as well as our engagement to him; and never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by us: <hi>Return</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.) <hi>Back-ſliding Children, and I will heal your Back-ſlidings: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for I am Married to you: I will be your God and guide even unto Death: I will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee,</hi> &amp;c. And this minding and remembring of Gods part of the Covenant, is a crediting of his Promiſe; Many Believers mind and remember their own part of the Covenant, but forget that God is tyed to them: which is to Remember, not a Mutuall engagement, ſuch as the Covenant bears out, but only our own Particular
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:179825:153"/> engagement, which makes us have ſo many failings on our ſide, and doth very much weaken our hands in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; becauſe we lay not the weight of our performances on God that hath Promiſed, <hi>who is faithful and will alſo do it:</hi> We will find it to be frequent and familiar to the Saints men ioned in Scripture, to mind Gods part of the Covenant as well as their own, and Particularly to <hi>David</hi> in the Book of Pſalmes, who ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made a Covenant with thine anointed: Thou haſt laid help upon one that is Mighty: art not thou from Everlaſting our God? Lord remember thy Covenant,</hi> that is the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> that God hath made with his People; and of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en elſe where. The great weight of a Believers life and conſolation lyes here: Alace! what would our life, or our engagement be, and what would our Comfort and Hope be, without his engagement to us in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? And if this be not ſuitably minded and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it will prove but a very heartleſs bargain. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It implies this, Seriouſly to endeavour to conform our Practice to the many great Obligations that we ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him, and which Gods offer and Covenant do on many accounts call us to. This is a ſhort hint of what it is <hi>to keep and do the Covenant of God, and to Perform it alway even unto the end,</hi> to have <hi>his Covenant Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and never to be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Second.</hi> To wit, the grounds and reaſons of this, and whereby it may be preſſed. <hi>Firſt.</hi> We would think of and believe the reality of Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the reality of the promiſes in it, and of all that is ſpoken of it; and would put our ſelves to it, if indeed we look on it as ſuch. The truth is, it is the Language of our unbelief, that we ſcarcely think God to be in earneſt; as if all that is ſpoken of this Covenant were but a cunningly deviſed Fable: If we really believed,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:179825:153"/> that by his Bleſſed Covenant, we may be brought to enjoy God and to be made conform to his Image in Holineſs: to have our vile bodies at laſt made conform to his Glorious Body, &amp;c. And that as certainly we ſhall be poſſeſſed of ſuch great and glorious priviledges by keeping this Covenant, as we a e certain that this world is yet ſtanding; ſuch a Faith would prove to us <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen, and the Subſtance of things hoped for:</hi> and would be a notable inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>argain, and will have wonderfull following, to all that keep it: and whether this be now Believed or not, it will be found a litle hence, that this bargain was one of the beſt that ever was heard tell of in the world. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We would ſeriouſly bethink our ſelves, what will come of it, in caſe there be Groſly unfaithfull dealing, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtedfaſtneſs in Gods Covenant. I ſhal only name theſe <hi>five</hi> things that will follow on it. 1. Much ſin. 2. Much ſhame. 3 Much reflection on God. 4. Much wrath, and. 5. Much want of peace, and much anxiety in the Conſcience, that is guilty of this ſin. 1. I ſay, much ſin: better there had never been a Covenant in your offer, and that ye had never proteſt your entering into Covenant with God: <hi>It's better</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>not to vow to God, then to vow and not to perform:</hi> It had been better that many of you had been cruſhed in your Mothers belly, or that ye had been born <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and had lived and died ſo, then to be found among them that deal falſly in Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, The groſſeſt ſins of <hi>Pagans</hi> are in ſome reſpect as no ſins in compariſon of this, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. 2. There will be much ſhame before God, even ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Face, everlaſting ſhame: they <hi>shall riſe from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:179825:154"/> the dead to shame and everlaſting contempt, Dan.</hi> 12. Sinners will have much ſhame ere all be done, for every ſin, But ſuch as have wickedly betrayed their truſt to God, and after they had made Profeſſion of entring in Covenant with him, have dealt Perfidiouſly and falſly in it, will be in a manner hiſſed at amongſt devils and reprobat <hi>Pagans,</hi> who never had ſuch offers, neither made ſuch Profeſſions: and their condemnation will be acknowledged to carry eminent and conſpicuous deſert in it: Becauſe ſuch had a good bargain, and dealt treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly with God, and quite maried it to themſelves: they have often alſo much ſhame amongſt men; even here: <hi>The man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>That hears my ſayings and does them not, is like unto a foolish builder, that built his houſe one the ſand:</hi> and elſewhere he reſembles raſh engagers in profeſt Covenanting with him, to men who ſit not down to count the coſt, that begin to build, and not being able to finiſh, expoſe themſelves to the Mockage, Scorn and Deriſion of all that paſs by: Such and ſuch a man (will ſome be ready to ſay) was a great Profeſſor, but now behold what is become of him, take him up yonder, he ſeemed once to have ſome tenderneſs, but now he is quite turned aſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come groſs and looſe: Men of any Morall honeſty and ingenuity will be aſhamed to break their word &amp; to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olat their engagements one to another in worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: how much greater ſhame is it to break to God, and to deal falſly in his Covenant? 3. It hath deep reflections upon God: for the Covenant-breaker ſaith on the matter, that it repents him that ever he made it, for he hath never gotten good of it, and that God hath not been faithfull in keeping to him, and that therefore he thought himſelf looſed from all its Obligation: Now will any of you dare to ſay, that the Covenant is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:179825:154"/> not a good bargain, or that God is not a good, reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and faithfull party to deal with? <hi>What iniquity have y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Doubtleſs ſuch will find that they have played the fools egregiouſly <hi>in Committing theſe two great evils, in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking God the Fountain of living waters, and in digging to themſelves Ciſterns, even broken Ciſterns that could hold no water:</hi> O! If ye could Imagine, what ye will think of it ere long, when ye will not get a drop of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool your tongue, becauſe ye ſaid by your practice, that God was not worth the having, <hi>And to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, depart from us, we will have none of thee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r will we have the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> 4. Much want of peace and much anxietie will follow upon it, even the penitent and converting People of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.20, 21. have much bitterneſs on this account of Treacherous dealing in Gods Covenant: <hi>a voice of weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Lamentation is heard on the mountains, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael ſaying, we have perverted our way, we have forſaken the Lord our God,</hi> how much more bitterneſs of another nature, how much more Smart, vexation, Anguiſh, Agony, and gnawing of Conſcience ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners have, on account of their falſe and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious dealing in Gods Covenant? This will make the hearts of many to quake and tremble for terror: If ye get Repentance, it will be a heart-break to you; and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:179825:155"/> if ye get not repentance, much heart leſs heart-break and cruſhing is abiding you in the end for evermore; and O what trembling of heart, failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind may be betwixt and that! 5 Much wrath will follow on it in the day of the Lord, if it be continued in; and judge ye with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Third, viz.</hi> Some motives and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to excite you to be Faithful in Gods Covenant and to ſtudy to have it <hi>A perpetuall Covenant never to be forgotten;</hi> conſider in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, that it is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly good and none-ſuch bargain to them that keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, there is no bargain more lovely to them that keep touches with God; <hi>It's</hi> (ſaith dying <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.) <hi>all my Salvation and all my deſire,</hi> It hath all things in it that my heart can wiſh; we make a pitifull and poor life to our ſelves thorow our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing Gods Covenant; the Believer, by improving of it, might have (as we uſe to ſpeak) a Lords life, yea a Kings life, yea a life infinitly preferable to the life of all the great men, and Monarchs on earth; <hi>having all things, though Poſsesſing nothing,</hi> as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. and ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. <hi>I have all, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and have no lack,</hi> while, in the mean time, he was living on a litle Charity from others; we might have a good li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h it not exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Commend Gods Covenant, that neither Sickneſs,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:179825:155"/> Poverty, Reproach, Contempt, Perſecution, nor Death it ſelf, though violent and Bloody, can marr this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent life? when the Covenanter comes to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Who can lay any thing to his Charge? It is God that Juſtifieth, who shall condemn him?</hi> He hath a friend before him, <hi>Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant,</hi> and is in good-terms with God; The great advantage of it in this life and in that which is to come <hi>(for godlineſs is great gain, having the promiſe of both)</hi> may abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly commend the Covenant and Faithfulneſs in it: I am perſwaded, there is no ſuiter or wooer to court and put in for the ſinners heart &amp; affection, that can poſſibly out-bid Gods Covenant, can the <hi>Luſt of the eye, the Luſt of the flesh or the Pride of life,</hi> can Profit, Pleaſure, or Preferment make ſuch Proffers? Is there ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be had in ſerving them, as there is to be had in ſerving God? By the one, <hi>Ye bring forth fruit unto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and in the end reap Eternal Life;</hi> but by the other, <hi>Ye ſow to the flesh, and shall of the flesh reap Corruption,</hi> a poor and hungry Harveſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The very keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Covenant with God, is in it ſelf an advantage? It hath a great reward in the boſom of it; for it puts the Perſon to love God, to delight in him, to place its happineſs in him; to ſtudy. Holineſs and Mortification of Sin; and is there not great advantage in theſe? can ye think or ſay, that there is any prejudice in theſe and ſuch things as theſe, namely to be blameleſs in your Converſation; to be ſincere and not a Hypocrite, to be ſerious and not Luk-warm? I am perſwaded, that if ye will but put it ſeriouſly to your own Conſciences, ye will be forced to ſay, that Sincerity in Religion is better then Hypocriſie, and ſtedfaſtneſs in Gods Covenant, then Treachery, and what more do we call for? And Therefore let me, on this ground, and as ye would not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:179825:156"/> come in Tops with your own Conſciences, beſeech you to ſtudy Faithfulneſs in the Covenant: Gods Covenant hath a great advantage of the hearers of it, and of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed engagers in it, even a friend in their boſoms, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſcience, that will ſide with it, and ſay, that it was a good bargain, that the terms were very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, &amp; that no prejudice could come by it, but unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably much advantage; &amp; will tell the man, that it would have been his honor and for his profit, to have keeped it and to have been faithful in it; why then, will the Lord ſay, didſt thou deal falſly in it, and renounce it? The wretched mans Conſcience will anſwer, that there was no ſhadow of reaſon for it, it was plain <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> for <hi>to keep and do Gods Covenant and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is Peoples wiſdom before all Nations; Deut.</hi> 4. It is a ſad matter, that when men may have that which is infinitly preferable to what they are ſo eager in ſeeking after: even true Riches, Pleaſure and honour, Peace that paſteth all naturall underſtanding, Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, and every good thing, by Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God and by faithful dealing therein, that they ſhould not drive this as their great deſigne, and make it their great work and uptaking buſineſs; <hi>O That there were ſuch a heart in them</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.) <hi>That they might fear me and keep my Commandments al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever:</hi> Men are ready to ſay, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for our Families, and under that Specious pretext they ſhift this main work; but Ah! fools that they are; there is no way comparable to this, to provide for fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and Children, even to have themſelves and their Children entred into Gods Covenant and made to deal faithfully in it; this engageth him to provide for and become tutor unto the Mans Children; and is there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:179825:156"/> not great encouragement here, to have every good thing beſtowed, and all carking care and anxietie concerning our ſelves and Children removed? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We would conſider, that God is a ſingular good Party to deal with, very tender of them that aim to deal honeſtly with him; he is indeed ſevere and terrible, when he becomes the avenger of a broken Covenant; but he is moſt tender towards honeſt engagers, who ſincerely endeavour to keep touches with him, he is no rigid interpreter of their actions, but is ready to put the beſt ſenſe on them that they are capable of; <hi>Like as a Father</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.) <hi>Pitieth his Children, ſo doth the Lord Pitie them that fear him;</hi> He is a father that will take litle off the hand of his Children, when he knows them to have a will to the work, when he will not deal ſo with others; <hi>all his wayes are mercy and truth to them that keep his Covenant and his Teſtimonies;</hi> It's not meant of ſuch as keep it Perfectly; for ſo they needed not Mercy, but of them that honeſtly deſigne and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep it; and may not that encourage to be faithfull in Gods Covenant, that he is ſo eaſie to pleaſe? <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, that he hath graciouſly ſtuffed his Covenant with Promiſes meet for the thorow-bearing of them that would fain keep Covenant: if it be an evil heart that will not love God, which troubles them, the Promiſe is, <hi>I will Circumciſe their heart and the hearts of their ſeed to love the Lord their God;</hi> Whereas no others, who are without the Covenant, or deal unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in it, can expect the performance of any ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. If it be a back ſliding heart, the Promiſe is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. <hi>I will heal your back-ſlydings:</hi> If it be the fear of departing from God that troubles them, the Promiſe is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their heart, that they shall not depart from me;</hi> If it be the dominion of

Yea he hath alſo condeſcended to come under this engagement too, even to make us forth coming in the Covenant, <hi>I will call</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.) <hi>Upon the Lord who performeth all thing for me:</hi> It might have been ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> how wilt thou get all done that thou haſt undertaken? He anſwers, <hi>I will call upon him who performeth all things for me;</hi> And ſo I will get them all done and Performed, ſo as I may hope to be accepted on the Mediators account and for his ſake. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider the Mediator of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who is ſurety and Cautioner not only for believers debt, But alſo for their duty; Therefore he is called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>The ſurety of this better Covenant;</hi> and when Chriſt and we are engaged in one bond, there is ground for us to expect that ſomething will be got done, tho the principal debtor be not much worth, yet the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner is Worthy and infinitly reſponſible. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there are already many, who have paſſed thorow the troubleſome Sea of this world and have been Marvellouſly helped; and it's but a litle, and all you honeſt engagers to the Lord will be thorow the ſame Sea, and fairly ſet on Land; your warfare ere long will be at an end, the prize will be got without any more fighting: what is your fighting, ſighing and walking heavily, clothed, as it were, in mourning for a litle time?

            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Obſervation</hi> is, that <hi>The great mean of ſecuring a Covenanter &amp; making him ſtedfaſt, is, Faith exerciſed on God, or adhering to him by Faith, by vertue of this Covenant:</hi> It is not, to lay weight on or truſt to our own ſtrength: but ſeeing God hath made a promiſe of thorow-bearing, to undertake the duties that we are called to in his ſtrength, truſting to his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to his furniſhing of us, according to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: As, when poor ſinners are Summoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God, and they have no righteouſneſs of their own, they are to ſtep forward truſting to Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: So when they are called to dutie, and they have no ſtrength of their own to enable them to a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſcharge thereof, they are to conſider <hi>that God is faithfull, who hath promiſed and who will alſo do it:</hi> and
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:179825:158"/> indeed Believers have found in their comfortable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that when they have adventured on dutie with a believing look to Gods Covenanted ſtrength, they have found it go ſweetly &amp; ſurpriſingly well with them: Thus it is ſaid of thoſe <hi>worthies</hi> mentioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>That through faith, they wrought Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as they did all other things thereby: This alſo is it, which the Lord inculcateth, <hi>John</hi> 15. <hi>abide in me</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>and ye shall bring forth much fruit: as the branch cannot bear fruit of it ſelf, except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing:</hi> Where it is clear, that it's not enough, that we be in Chriſt, but that we muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in him, and have continuall dependance on him for the influences of life and ſtrength derived from him.</p>
            <p>Ye then that would be faithfull in Gods Covenant, &amp; would have it <hi>Perpetuall never to be forgotten,</hi> muſt eſpecially make uſe of this mean: make Conſcience of all other appointed means; <hi>Watch and pray that ye enter not into Tentation;</hi> but ſee that ye neglect not this mean; which if ye do, <hi>the Watchman will watch in vain:</hi> and your grip or hold will be unſiker, if ye make not uſe of him to make it ſure, and to keep it ſo. And therefore, 1. Mind ſeriouſly and conſtantly what ye are, in and of your ſelves; even fickle, fectleſs, weak, feeble and unconſtant creatures, not daring to undertake any thing in your own ſtrength. 2. Remember what God is; and that ye have a worthy, able and reſponſall Cautioner. 3. Remember that ye are engaged in a <hi>Covenant never to be forgotten:</hi> forgetting is the firſt riſe of unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 4. Remember the Promiſes that God hath made for your thorow-bearing, and let faith be exerciſed on them; Joyn with diligence and watchfulneſs a ſuitable exerciſe of Faith. 5. Take a ſerious look, every day
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:179825:158"/> when ye go to pray, of your reſolutions and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, renew them frequently and ſeriouſly in his own ſtrength; and be caſting the other knot; and put the heart diſtinctly to ſay, this was my bargain, and I will through Grace abide by it; and then go and pray over it, that ye may be made faithful in your thus Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, that ye may be enabled to pay your vowes and make your honeſt reſolutions Practicable; levelling at this as your Scope and deſigne in all duties: I have ſaid ſuch a thing and have not kept my word, Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give it for Chriſts ſake: I am engaged in this and that and the other duty, Lord help me to perform. And for your furtherance in humiliation and ſoft walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, look on all your ſins as aggravated by this unfaithful and treacherous dealing in Gods Covenant: and on all duties, as thoſe which your Covenant with God binds you to depend on him for ſtrength to be Communicated to you according to the Covenant, for going about them ſuitably and acceptably: and within a litle while ye ſhall get a fair paſs to be gone, and a full diſcharge of all that ye were truſted with according to the Covenant. And the Lord help you to be faithful, ſo that it may be betwixt God and you in very deed, <hi>A perpetuall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>

               </gap>e they might think and ſay, Alace! Lord, what will become of us, if we ſhall have no moe Communions with thee? Be not (ſaith he to them on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) diſcouraged, We ſhall yet have more and more intimat Communion then ever we had here on earth: There is a day coming, when we ſhall have a ſweet Communion in the Kingdom of Heaven to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when we ſhall drink it new, when we shal have the thing ſignified, Even Communion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the intervention of Ordinances, in the full Harveſt of joy in God, in his Kingdon. Then, <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. As if he were going to a Triumph, He and they ſing a <hi>Hymn</hi> or Pſalm: Partly thereby to teach us to be chearfull: and partly to shew that ſinging of Pſalmes is not unſuitable for this action.</p>
            <p>To make the former words and what we are to ſay on them a litle more clear: We would in this Sacrament, which here the Lord Explicats, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four</hi> things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſts Offer: Wherein there are <hi>Two</hi> things, <hi>viz.</hi> The outward and viſible ſignes, the Elements: and the inward inviſible thing ſignified by them, Which is Chriſts Body &amp; Blood: In the Offer then in short, We have not only the Element, or ſigne, but the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and repreſented by it: Even as in the word of the Goſpel, there are theſe <hi>Two, viz:</hi> So many words made up of Letters and Syllables, and the matter Contained in them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the receiving of Chriſts offer, wherein there are <hi>Two</hi> things, 1. The act of receiving the Element by the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:179825:161"/> hand. 2. The hearts receiving what is offered in and by the Elements: Even as in hearing the word, There is the giving or lending of the ear to the voice of words, that they may be underſtandingly heard, and there is the receiving what is ſpoken, by Faith in the heart: As Chriſt holds forth both in his offer, ſo the Believer would both wayes receive, by the hand the Element should be received, and by Faith the thing ſignified should be received. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ye would conſider this Application of the thing ſignified in <hi>a twofold</hi> reſpect, 1. As it holds out the entering of us into the Covenant in order to the receiving of the Pardon of ſin, when the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Conſidered complexly with the word. 2. As it Applyeth Chriſt and the benefits that come by him for our conſolation: Chriſt is to be received in the former reſpect, before he can be received in the Letter: we muſt needs receive Chriſt in his offer, ere we can receive any benefit that comes by him: Therefore the word goes along with the Sacrament, that we may get a gripe and catch hold of Chriſt by the Covenant: for they that are without the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are without Chriſt and all ſaving benefit by him: But where Chriſt is received, and Faith cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with him as he is offered, The Soul may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably make Application of him, Not only for Pardon of ſin, The Particular benefit here expreſly mentioned, but for all the other benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: Whereas they who have not faith, have nothing, and receive nothing: but are deeply guilty thorow their not receiving, but rather rejecting and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:179825:161"/> deſpiſing of Chriſt and his benefits. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Ye would conſider this Sacrament, as it ſeals directly our warrant to receive Chriſt and his benefi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As all theſe other things do Concurr to make out the excellency of the Bargain; So doth this in a ſpecial manner; that the price is payed, that they have nothing to lay down, but may come and take all freely without money and without price.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For furthering and ſtrengthening the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, ye would conſider, that the Believer who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives Chriſt as he is offered in the Goſpel, though he be a ſinner, yet he hath a moſt ſufficient, excellent and unqueſtionable ſecurity for, and right unto all theſe good things, that our dieing Lord Jeſus hath comprehended in his Teſtament: Believing ſinners, what ſecurity would ye have? ye have Chriſts word, <hi>I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c. Ye have Chriſts Covenant and Teſtament; <hi>This is the Cup of the New Teſtament in my Blood;</hi> and now the Teſtament is Confirmed and Sealed, ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nor Angel can annull nor alter it; Our Lords Teſtament being Sealed it ſtands legally regiſtred in the Court Books of Heaven; and it ſtands legal on theſe terms, that a ſinner who takes with his ſin, diſclaims his own righteouſneſs, and betakes himſelf to Chriſts
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:179825:166"/> Righteouſneſs, putting it in the room of his own, for his Juſtification before God; may be ſure of Chriſts legacy and of Heaven: as it's ſure, that Chriſt ſuffered, and Inſtituted this Sacrament for his Confirmation in the Faith of it; the accepting of Chriſt, the ſubmitting to his righteouſneſs, the yeelding to the Covenant, and cloſing with him on his own terms, gives him a right to Heaven and all the Riches contained in his Teſtament. To make out this, as being the very thing of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Application of all that hath been ſaid, and of what we are further to ſay; I ſhall offer theſe <hi>four</hi> grounds; The <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof is, ſome clear Scriptures, that hold forth ſo much, <hi>viz.</hi> That as really they ſhall have life who rake Chriſt and his offer, and cloſe with him; as he really ſuffered and Satisfied the Juſtice of God for their ſins. The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Scriptures is <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him;</hi> He is an able Saviour, able to the uttermoſt, and there is not a point of Latitude, longitude or altitude beyond the <hi>uttermoſt;</hi> He is able to ſave them all, and what all? All that will come and make uſe of him, and give him the credit of his Offices; all that will <hi>come unto God by him.</hi> A <hi>Second is, Rom.</hi> 5 20. Where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> out-reaſons ſin, for holding forth the triumph of free-Grace; <hi>Where ſin abounded</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Grace did much more abound; That as ſin hath reigned unto death, Even ſo</hi> (and indeed it is an excellent <hi>So) might Grace Reigne through Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> though we would endeavour to our utmoſt to unfold theſe words, we could not unfold all that is infolded in them; did ſin make ſinners lyable to death, and Triumph over them? So Grace hath erected a Throne, by Chriſts Righteouſneſs, not by inherent Holineſs, and hath
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:179825:167"/> Triumphed over ſin: the way how Grace gives out its orders and obtains its end, Is not by our Righteouſneſs, but by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, through Faith in him; Juſtice (to ſpeak with reverence) is off the Throne, and Grace orders and ſways all, in making Application of Chriſts Purchaſed Righteouſneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. The <hi>Third</hi> Scripture is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>Be it known unto you, therefore, Men and Breth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or what can the Law, Juſtice or Satan claime? ye are Juſtified from all theſe things: and when he ſpeaks thus to deſpiſers with a <hi>Be it known unto you,</hi> That the offer is made to them, we may on good ground turn it over to you, and ſay, <hi>Be it known unto you, that thorow Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ye may have <hi>Remisſion of ſins, and be Juſtified from all things from which ye could not be Juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> According to the terms of the Covenant: Let your libell be as long as it will; Grace is on the Throne and will receive you. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, that the great deſigne which the Lord drives in the buſineſs of Redemption and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in the Goſpel, Is, that Remiſſion of ſins and Life may be made ſure to loſt Sinners that came to Chriſt: Why I pray, was the Covenant made? was it not for this end? As it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>This is my Covenant</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael, I will be Merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and Iniquities will I remember no more; no more,</hi> O ſweet ſound! What is the deſigne of the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:179825:167"/> Mediator in his Sufferings? Is it not this? So <hi>John</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come, that they might have Life and have it more abundantly,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>For their ſakes I Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf, that they alſo may be Sanctified;</hi> and here, <hi>the new Covenant in his Blood is for the Remisſion of the ſins of many:</hi> and this being the mean for attaining the end. It is Impoſſible, that it can miſgive or fail. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider the Contrivance of the Covenant, and ye will ſee, that it is impoſſible it can fall; Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner fail, then one Title of this ſworn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Covenant: It cannot fail on the Mediators ſide, for he hath Payed the price already; Neither can it fail on <hi>Jehovahs</hi> ſide, He will not fail to make Application of Grace to ſinners, nor be unfaithful to the Faithfull Mediator; And ſince upon the one ſide, Juſtice had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to exact of Chriſt the full price, even to the leaſt farthing, by vertue of the Covenant of Redemption, when he became ſurety; will not the ſame Covenant, on the other ſide, make it out, that Grace ſhall have as good acceſs to Pardon the ſinner, for whom be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took? <hi>For he</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) <hi>was made ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> If the Covenant (which is one) hath had the deſigned effect in and on the Mediator, as to his fulfilling all that was undertaken by him therein; ſhall not the Promiſes made to him, as namely theſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.10.11. <hi>He shall ſee his ſeed, the Pleaſure of the Lord shall Proſper in his hand; by his knowledge shall my righteous ſervant juſtify many,</hi> take effect and be fulfilled? Doubtleſs they will moſt certainly and infruſtrably. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider the great experience which the Saints have had of the truth of this in all ages; are there any this day before the Throne, Bleſſing the Lamb and him that ſits thereon, or any
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:179825:168"/> that are on their way thither ward; But they are ſo many wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſſes of this Truth, that cloſing with Chriſt hath good Security for Remiſſion of ſins, and for Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? There ſhall never be one who ſhall have it to ſay, I truſted to this ſecurity, and it failed me: and hereupon riſeth the ſweet Song, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdome, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blesſing, Revel.</hi> 5.12. Nay even thoſe in the Pit ſhall bear witneſs to this truth; for (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>We are unto God a ſweet Savour in them that are ſaved and in them that Perish; to the one we are the Savour of Death unto death: and to the other, the Savour of Life unto life;</hi> And in the preceeding words he ſaith, <hi>Thanks be to God which alwayes cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt;</hi> He mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Triumph of the Faithfull Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſome way, to be in them that are damned, by his taking Vengeance on them, for deſpiſing His Grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: and they are made to ſee, that it was a ſure bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to them that through Grace embraced it. And it this be ſo Good a bargain to them that embrace it, and ſo very ſiker and ſure, What, I pray, are we ſeeking? But that this good bargain and the ſufficient ſecurity thereof may be taken hold on, as it is propoſed: alter not the terms of it; and indeed it would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to preſume to do ſo, or ſo much as to deſire an alteration of them: for though we had them at our own contriving, We could never, by very fat, contrive them ſo well: Nay let me ſay, if Angels were Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, they would think it a Priviledge to have acceſs to mention His precious Name. Now ſeeing it is the Great deſigne of the Goſpel to have ſinners cloſing with Chriſt on his own Terms: O do not fruſtrat the Grace of God: And ſeeing Grace makes offer of Life
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:179825:168"/> Life and of Remiſſion of ſins to ſinners, to ſave them freely: let Grace get ſuch ſinners to ſave as it's ſeeking, and it ſhall be a bargain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To proſecute this yet a litle further: ye would conſider, that, as there is a good bargain to be had thorow Chriſt and by Faith in him, and as there is good ſecurity for it: ſo it is our Lords delight and good Pleaſure, and he is very deſirous that ſinners ſhould make Application of it by Faith, receive and reſt on him and his righteouſneſs, for making themſelves eternally Happy: We are not ſpeaking of ſuch a Happineſs and ſecurity, that the Lord will be angry at you if ye take hold of it: but of a happineſs and ſecurity, that he is ſeriouſly willing ye ſhould receive: And he doth moſt earneſtly beſeech you to take hold of this Covenant on theſe Sweet and eaſy terms, that ye be Heartily content and well Pleaſed with it. O ſenſible ſinners, do ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed believe this, when we Preach to you, that our Lord Jeſus is as deſirous to have you ſaved, as ye are; and that his righteouſneſs be cloſed with, as ye are to have it? Nay more: that there was never a Soul more hungry and greedy (when with a heart chock-full of deſires after it) to Communicat, then he is ſeriouſly willing to admit ſuch a Soul to Commonion with him? Then, as ye would do him a Pleaſure (and it's all that ye can do) keep not a diſtance but ſtep to, and take what he Offers; not only the Sacrament, but himſelf in it, for your head, Husband and Lord: and that ye may not Scare-ſtand, nor halt, to do ſo: Conſider, that there is not only a warrant to come, but that he calleth you to come, and is ready heartily to welcome you; come on his call; and his call is no leſs broad, then the call of the Goſpel; there is a warrant given you, on your hearing of the Goſpel, and quiting of your own
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:179825:169"/> righteouſneſs, to receive Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, and to admit of him to the exerciſe of his offices about you according to the Covenant: And indeed we know not a truth of the Goſpel that hath mo confirmations then this hath, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt the Mediator is very willing and deſirous, that ſinners cloſe with him, and get the good of his Purchaſe. For the making out of which, take theſe following Conſiderations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> what is the great deſigne of the Covenant, but this? As we have it. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to Preach good tidings to the meek, He hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to Proclaim liberty to the Captives, to give to them that mourn beauty for Ashes, the Oyl of joy for Mourning, and the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſs;</hi> and this is called <hi>the Proclaiming of the acceptable year of the Lord:</hi> Wherein all the three Perſons of the Bleſſed Trinity concurr, as is clear, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. Conſider, <hi>Secondly,</hi> All his Offices, and ye will find that they Preach and Proclaim the ſame thing; his Name is <hi>Jeſus</hi> becauſe <hi>He ſaves his People from their ſins:</hi> He is King, Prieſt and Prophet for this end: and what ſaith his Preaching and Corroſpondent Prayer, <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>Father I will, that they whom thou haſt given me, be with me,</hi> but that he would fain have them there? And what ſhall I ſay? Is there any proof of it, that can be given beyond His Death? <hi>I lay down my life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for my sheep;</hi> The Salvation of loſt Elect ſinners went very near his heart; Therefore, when none in Heaven nor on earth can help, then ſaith he, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O my God. Thirdly,</hi> Conſider, with what Pleaſure and delight he went about the work of Redemption; As is very clear in that 40th. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where he heartſomly ſaith, <hi>Lo I come, I delight to do
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:179825:169"/> thy will:</hi> I even haſten to undertake it; And when he is come, he ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 4.34. <hi>It is my meat, to do the will of him that ſent me and to finish his work:</hi> and what work was that? Even to lay down his Life, to gather the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to take away the ſeud that was betwixt God and them, and to Reconcile them to him: and when it cometh to the very puſh of actuall laying down his life; He will not open his month to divert it: though he might have commanded more then twelve Legions of Angels, yet he would not do it: <hi>for this cauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Came I into this World. Fourthely,</hi> Conſider the end of all the Ordinances; wherefore are they inſtituted? what ſaith the word, but that <hi>Thorow this man is preached unto you forgiveneſs of ſins?</hi> What ſay Miniſters, but that <hi>We are Ambaſſadours in Chriſt, ſtead, beſeching you to be Reconciled unto God?</hi> Which evidenceth Plainly, that Chriſt would fain (to ſpeak ſo) have peace made betwixt God and ſinners, and them ſaved: and what ſaith the Sacrament, but even the words of the Text? <hi>This is the new Covenant in my Blood shed for the Remisſion of the ſins of many:</hi> And can we think on the end of theſe Ordinances, but we muſt alſo think on Chriſts willingneſs, that ſinners ſhould make Application of him and of his Purchaſe? <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Conſider further, How he eſteems of a ſinners coming to him, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Joy in Heaven at the Converſion of a ſinner:</hi> We may ſay, that it is the gladneſs of his heart, when any ſinner cometh home to him: Therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>the pleaſure of the Lord shall proſper in his hand, and he shall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be Satisfied, Iſaiah</hi> 53.10, 11. It is Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to him for all the Travel of his Soul, to ſee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners coming in and getting good of him: and in the <hi>Song.</hi> He is ſaid <hi>to feed in the Gardens and to be gathering
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:179825:170"/> lilies;</hi> Yea, that the day of Souls being <hi>eſpouſed to him,</hi> is <hi>the day of the gladneſs of his heart. Sixthly,</hi> Conſider, how weighted (to ſpeak ſo with reverence to him) our Lord is, when ſinners will not make uſe of him, it's accounted by him, as it were; an affronting of him, Even <hi>a troading of the Blood of the Covenant under foot, and an accounting of it to be an unholy thing,</hi> a ſort and degree of <hi>doing deſpight to the Spirit of Grace:</hi> He who could look ſometimes on the wrath of God and not ſhed a tear; yet, when he came to <hi>Jeruſalem, weeped over it:</hi> And upon the other hand, O! what compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency hath he in a ſinners coming home to him, which makes him ſweetly ſmile and rejoice. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his exceeding great forbearance toward ſinners, while they are ſtraying, and his exceeding heartie wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of them, when they return. Let an inqueſt (to ſay ſo) be led on his Procedure with all the hearers of the Goſpel, that are here on earth, and with all that are in Heaven and hell, and all of them will be conſtrained to ſubſcribe to the truth of this, that he is full of long-ſuffering: Doth he not ſpare even the veſſels of wrath fitted to diſtruction? And doth He not, only ſpare his own, but Pity them as a Father pitieth his Children? And that wonderfull weſcom of the Father to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal Son is nothing to Chriſts welcoming of a repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner, being but a dark Reſemblance of it; He caſts not up to him his bygone faults, Neither ſayes, what is this you have done, miſerable wretch? No ſuch word; but <hi>This is my Son that was dead, and is alive, that was loſt and now is found:</hi> Believe it, O Believe it, (which is the very ſcope of the Parable) Our Lord Jeſus is as glad in a Holy way at a ſinners coming home. <hi>Eightly,</hi> Conſider, how eaſie our Lord is to be pleaſed with any honeſt mint or eſſay that is made of returning
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:179825:170"/> to him; He is ſo very willing, that a ſinner make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of his Righteouſneſs, that where there is reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he will (as it were) take half a Faith for Faith, were it even, but like <hi>a Smoking flax or bruised Reed,</hi> or a <hi>grain of muſtard ſeed;</hi> He will take a ſincere reſolution to confeſs, for the confeſſion of ſin; which is clear, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. <hi>I ſaid</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) I will confeſs my Tranſgresſion, and thou forgav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt the Iniquity of my ſin:</hi> If he had propoſed the offer of life on ſuch terms, as would have wearied us all our dayes, we ought to have Judged him willing that we ſhould partake of it, for it coſt him very dear; But when it is not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith only, but any Faith how weak ſo ever, if ſound, that he graciouſly accepts; How doth it ſet forth his great willingneſs? <hi>Him that cometh to me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> The word is doubled in the Original <hi>I will not, Not,</hi> to ſhew the holy paſſionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Lords deſire, and his exceeding great willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have ſinners cloſing with him; So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45. Salvation is promiſed even to <hi>a Look, look unto me all the ends of the Earth and be Saved;</hi> and if ſinners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well look, think but honeſtly and let their heart yeeld and it ſhall be a bargain; <hi>He that is athirſt let him come, Revel.</hi> 22. And if there be ſcarce the pain of Hunger or Thirſt, <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay come, and whoſoever will, let him come and take of the Water of Life freely;</hi> And this willingneſs is nothing elſe, but the thought and deſire of an heart conſenting to accept of his offer: Or if this be not litle enough, there is leſs yet, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord,</hi> the word (as it is on the Margent and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.1.) is, <hi>be ſilent to the Lord;</hi> If the heart cannot ſo well and diſtinctly ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the bargain, Let it (as it were) hold its tongue or hold its peace; let it be ſilent, ſay nothing

            <p>The <hi>Second uſe</hi> is of <hi>Exhortation:</hi> and ye may at firſt bluſh ſee, whither it runs, Even to ſtir us up to accept of and embrace theſe good news with glad hearts, is there here a good bargain and a ſure way through Faith to make uſe of it? And is Chriſt ſo willing to Communicat it? What ſhall I ſay to you! Is it not a pity to miſs it? Nay would ye do Chriſt a pleaſure? then lay weight on his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and give him ſinfull Souls to be ſaved by him: if we ſought great or hard things from you to pleaſe him, would you not judge your ſelves oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grant them? But when he ſaith on the matter, give me your Souls to be ſaved, and I ſhal account that Satisfaction to me for all the travell of my Soul: O How unſpeakably great is your Obligation readily and cheerfully to grant ſo loving and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a requeſt <hi>l</hi> If ſuch a gracious offer had never been made.

There is not a deſigne in this Goſpel to ſave any others but ſinners; and if ſo, to <hi>you is this Salvation ſet,</hi> who by Nature are ſinners, enemies, and at feud with God: The Doctrine of this Goſpel carries in its boſom Remiſſion of ſins: would to God ye were ſuitably affected with ſin, and Judging your ſelves, that ſo ye might be in ſome Capacity to receive it. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>condly,</hi> Tell me what is it that ye would be at? Is it Remiſſion of ſins? It's here: would ye have the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:179825:173"/> Covenant and Promiſes? here they are: Is it Chriſt himſelf that ye would have, becauſe ye dare not truſt to a promiſe without a Cautioner? Here he is: or would ye have Heaven and be Eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? It's alſo here. Conſider then, I beſeech you, what is in your Offer: dare you ſay, that the ſecurity is not valid, good and ſufficient? And if ye ſhould, there are many witneſſes in Heaven againſt you, and alſo the Sacrament on Earth, which now is offered to confirm you: This bargain therefore, and its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity muſt be receiv'dr elſe wo unto you for ever: This word which we now Preach, Nay theſe ſtones shall bear witneſs againſt you, that our Lord Jeſus was willing to ſave you and every one of you, and ye would not: And therefore your Blood shall be required at your own hand, and He found without any the leaſt Culpable acceſſion to it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ye are either to Communicat to day, or ye are only to be hearers and Spectators: whether the one or the other, Is there not a neceſſity that ye cloſe this bargain. If ye be to Communicat, will ye take the Bread and wine and misken and ſlight Chriſt? If ſo, ye will eat and drink your own Damnation: would you have the Character of a right Communicant? This is it, that ye renounce your own, and truſt to his Righteouſneſs, and take the Sacrament for a confirmation of your intereſt in it: If ye come thus, ye shal be welcome, for this Ordinance is appointed for this very end: if ye be not to Communicat, this word of the Goſpel comes to you: though ye have ſecluded your ſelves from the Sacrament, either
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:179825:173"/> thorow Ignorance or ſcandal: It might be a ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to you, If yet Chriſt get a welcome, and it ſhould, I aſſure you in his Name, make way to a new communion here or in Heaven. But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would a litle mote particularly beſeech you to conſider, that ye muſt either give Chriſt a welcome or not, a yea or a nayſay, a grant or a denyal, for there is no mean or middle: This day ſhall not paſs and go by without a hit or a miſs (to ſpeak ſo) Chriſt will not knock at your door, and nothing follow or be done: It will either be, that Chriſt was at ſuch a time (ruzed or) commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made offer of, and his People would have none of him: or that the heart opened as the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> unto the Lord, and that Salvation came to the Soul, as it did to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe: your time is but ſhort and uncertain, Ye know not if ye ſhall come another Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath to hear: ſome that now ſpeak to you, and ſome that hear are dayly removed: And this bids you make haſte to creep in to him quickly without longer delay, while his armes are ſtretched out to receive and embrace you: There are ſeveral ſorts among you, that keep at a diſtance from Chriſt: but I would have all of you ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly to think, whether ye will ſay <hi>Yea</hi> or <hi>Nay:</hi> There is here what may ſilence and ſatisfy any Soul that thwarts with the call of God: Can ye ſay, that there is any better bargain, any better ſecurity, or any heartier call and invitation? <hi>Let us come and reaſon together ſaith the Lord (Iſaiah</hi> 1.18, 19) <hi>Though your ſins be as Crimſon, they shall be as white as Snow, though they be red as Scarlet, they shal be as Wooll: if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land, but if ye refuſe and rebel ye shall be deſtroyed.</hi> Our Lords Blood is of that efficacy, that it can make Crimſon and Scarlet-coloured ſins, white, white as Snow and Wooll: Why do ye then linger, ſtick, ſtand or halt?</p>
            <pb n="326" facs="tcp:179825:174"/>
            <p>Ye will, it may be, <hi>Object</hi> and ſay. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I would fain come, if I durſt: but Conſider, I pray you, that it's Chriſt and the Covenant, and Grace on the Throne that call you: and this is their voice, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken and done evil as thou couldeſt, yet return unto me:</hi> and therefore fear and tremble, yet come: fear and bring your ſins with you to the Fountain to be waſhen, and to a skirt of his love, to be covered thereby: and you ſhall on your coming be cleanſed and covered. But it may be, ye will <hi>Next Object</hi> and ſay, I would fain come, but I cannot come, for <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Let me ask you, Is there a Soul in hell this day that can ſay I would fain have come and could not come? That which we ſeek of you is, to make no long, tedious or toilſome Voyage, if there be honeſty: it's only, that when Chriſt is come to you ye will be willing to receive him, and if ye thus come, ye are Believers: Do not, I beſeech you, miſtake, in thinking (and thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing your own coming) that perſons muſt firſt be Believers and then come to Chriſt, No, but firſt ye muſt come with the litle glimmering that ye have, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it's like, ſome will in the <hi>Third</hi> place. <hi>Object</hi> and ſay, Alace, I am very indiſpoſed to come. For <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> I ſhall grant, it may indeed be true: but yet con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſider who are invited, it's the <hi>Poor, Blind, Halt, Maim<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, Wretched</hi> and <hi>Miſerable:</hi> O what unfitneſs have ſuch! and yet none of them are excepted againſt: I would have none to be preſumptuous and vain: but if indeed ye would fain come, ye cannot come ſo indiſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:179825:174"/> as the bargain will on that account be caſt: It will not be the want of a Diſpoſition that ſhall caſt it, elſe the <hi>Cripple</hi> and <hi>Blind,</hi> and <hi>Luke warm Laodiceans</hi> had never been invited: whether is a ſuitable diſpoſition of your own making or of Chriſts? Sure it's of his: and can ye expect ought from him without coming to him, or Believing in him? But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Some will <hi>Object</hi> and ſay, Alace I have often come and broken away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, How can I then Believe that I am invited? For <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I would deſire you to Conſider, whether that Objection tends, Even to queſtion the truth of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; our Lord Jeſus ſaith, <hi>He came to ſave ſinners,</hi> and ye ſay I would fain know if that be true or not; if ye be <hi>Poor, Blind, Miſerable, Naked,</hi> &amp;c. And have need, He commands us to invite and call ſuch; and it's the way of unbelief to make them ſcare at Chriſt and ſtand furtheſt a back from him, who have moſt need to draw near to him; if ye have come and broken after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Come again: and where a knot hath not holden, caſt a new one: But alace! There is a ſort of Careleſs Atheiſts and ſecure Hypocrits, whom this Goſpel ſtrikes dead: and carnall worldlings, who have no ſerious thoughts of what is coming: I would poſe ſuch, and ask you, Care ye for your Souls? care ye for Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins? Or care ye for the enjoying of God? If ye do, then ſure, it is unſpeakably of your concernment to conſider and cloſe with the call &amp; offer of this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: And if there be any of you, that have loved your Idols, and after them will go, I would deſire you in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſs to ſay to it, will ye prefer any Idol to Chriſt, the Creature to the Creator, the temporal finfull being of your body to the Eternall well-being of both Soul and Body? If ye will, then be ſure, that this Conviction, in your Judgement and Conſcience, will go along with

            <head type="sub">SERMON II.</head>
            <p>OUr Bleſſed Lord Jeſus is now near taking leave of his Apoſtles, and preparing them for the ſtorm they were to meet with; and for the conſolation of them and of all his followers to the end of the World, He inſtituteth this Ordinance of the Communion, to be His Love-token in His abſence; that all his People might be confident of his reſpect to them, as well as to thoſe then Preſent; and that all of them might thereby be put and kept in the Remembrance of him, till his coming again.</p>
            <p>He hath given them a <hi>Masſie</hi> and marrowy Sum of the Goſpel in the words immediatly Preceeding; <hi>This Cup</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is my Blood of the New Teſtament shed for the Remisſion of the ſins of many;</hi> To which he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, partly for warning, partly for Conſolation, theſe now read, <hi>But I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the Vine, till I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom:</hi> as if he had ſaid, though now we be
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:179825:177"/> ſitting here at the Communion-Table heartſomely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I tell you, that I and ye will have no mo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions here on earth; The particle <hi>But</hi> is to give them a watch-word; and yet according to his bleſſed manner and wont, he hath the beſt word hindmoſt, and tells them glad news on the back of it; For they might ſay, Wo's us, ſweet Maſter, will we never meet again at a Communion? think not ſo, ſaith he; we ſhall yet meet again and have a ſweet Communion in Heaven: This then is a very heartſome diſmiſs: though he ſends them away, advertiſing them of a ſtorm coming, and though they knew not well what was before them; yet he heartens and encourages them with a Promiſe, that they ſhall have this Wine new, or the thing ſignified by it, with a far other reliſh, in Glory: and that then he and they ſhould have good days of it: I ſhall ſay no more to the expoſition, ſcope, or Diviſion of the words. Take this one <hi>Doctrine</hi> from them, and then a few things on the Connexion, for <hi>Uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Then, implyed is this, That <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will have a ſweet Communion in Chriſts Fathers Kingdom, in Heaven.</hi> This is Expreſly in the Text, and confirmed by other Scriptures, as namely, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.29. <hi>Ye are they that have continued with me in my Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me: That ye may eat and Drink at my Table in my Kingdom:</hi> This is that Communion, even a partaking of Chriſts Glory in his Fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and with him in it; and <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>The Glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them;</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Father I will that they whom thou haſt given me may be with me to Behold my Glory, which thou haſt given me;</hi> which words ſet forth, not only the certainty of the thing; a glorious place and day, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:179825:177"/> of the Feaſt, but alſo a ſort of Peremptorineſs in reference thereto, <hi>Father I will,</hi> ſaith he: when he Prayed, that the Cup might depart from him, he does it Conditionally and with ſubmiſſion; but when he prayes for Communion in Glory to him and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, there is no Submiſſion (to ſpeak ſo) becauſe it was according to the Covenant of Redemption, and therefore he is abſolut and Holily peremptory in it, <hi>And the Father hears him alwayes:</hi> So in the Epiſtles written to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia, Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. It is Promiſed by our Lord, to him that overcometh, that he <hi>will give him the hidden Manna, the white ſtone, and New Name; to ſit with him on his Throne:</hi> Let all Believers on earth be gathered together, they cannot tell what this is, what a <hi>Manna</hi> what a <hi>Communion</hi> this will be; it quite tranſcends all experience, all expreſſion and conception: Only in the Text 'its called, 1. <hi>Wine,</hi> which is a very cordiall thing, 'tis <hi>Meat indeed and Drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi> 2. It's called <hi>new Wine;</hi> we taſte of it here, but it's new and hath another reliſh there. 3. 'Tis in a ſweet place, not in any Earthly houſe or upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not in a material Temple made with hands, but in Chriſts <hi>Fathers</hi> Kingdom, that <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> that <hi>Tabernacle of God,</hi> where God dwelleth with Angels and Glorified Saints; <hi>the City paved with pure Gold;</hi> the <hi>Gates whereof are Pearl; the foundations of the Wall whereof are garnished with all manner of Precious ſtones;</hi> which <hi>hath no Sun, but the Glory of God and of the Lamb</hi> is the <hi>light thereof.</hi> O Believers, who have ſome of you, but Cot-houſes, ſmoky holes here, ye ſhall have Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Glory there, admirably good accomodation: it is with excellent &amp; <hi>non ſuch</hi> company, even with Chriſt; For he ſays, that <hi>He</hi> will drink this wine new <hi>with us</hi> in his Fathers Kingdom. It's a great matter to get leave to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:179825:178"/> ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob, David</hi> and the Prophets <hi>Elijah, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of them; with <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> with <hi>Paul, John, Peter,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, and with the whole <hi>Congregation of the firſt-born;</hi> but it's more, to drink the new wine with Chriſt himſelf, in heaven, who is (to ſay ſo) the very heart of Heaven. This Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath in it theſe <hi>Five</hi> notable qualifications. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's immediat: all our Communion here is mediat, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Miniſters interveen and come betwixt us and him; and there is need of Faith in order to it; but in that Communion above, there is no intermediat mean, there we ſhall <hi>ſee his face,</hi> as it's ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.4. There, is no Temple, no Miniſters, no Preaching, no light of candle or Sun there, but the Lamb and the Lord God who enlightens it; the Tabernacle of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will then be taken down, every thing which is <hi>in part</hi> will be done away, when that which is <hi>perfect</hi> is come: <hi>The Lord shall feed, and the Lamb shall lead us by theſe living waters. Secondly,</hi> There is in it a ſharing of the ſame Glory with the Mediator, He and we ſhall drink of one Cup, ſit at one Table, and ſit on one Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. We ſhall partake of Chriſts Glory: <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>that they Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Glory;</hi> there we get eminently <hi>The new Name and the Name of the City of Chriſts God, Rev.</hi> 3. there <hi>his Name will be in our fore-heads, Rev.</hi> 22.4. <hi>And our vile bodies will be made conformable to Chriſts Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Body. Phil.</hi> 3.21. Our ſpirits will be made pure as he is pure; when we ſhall be raiſed in incorruption, we ſhall bear the Image of the Heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> and our bodies ſhall be made <hi>Spiritual:</hi> It cannot be told what this will be, to be made Partakers of Chriſts Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when the fulneſs of the God head ſhall be Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:179825:178"/> to us Ojectively, and when God ſhall be <hi>all in all. Thirdly,</hi> It's a Communion ſatisfieing compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; If Chriſts Communion be full, ours ſhall be full; in this Communion none ſhall complain of deſertion, none ſhall deſire more of the Spirit, or more conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for it ſhall be full; then ſhall we Satisfieingly <hi>know the love of Chriſt that paſſeth knowledge,</hi> and <hi>be filled with all the fulneſs of God;</hi> this water of Life will Satisfie to the full the greateſt thirſt of ſuch as long for Chriſt; there ſhall not be (to ſpeak ſo) an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Corner in the moſt capacious Soul; thou Poor hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and thirſty, Empty and indigent Believing Soul ſhalt then be full and keeped full (according to Creature capacity) to the very Brim; and thy heart that is now narrow and ſtraitned, ſhall be widened end enla ged then, to take in this ſweet and Satisfieing: there ſhall not be one veſſel in Glory, but it ſhall be filled brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with the new Wine of theſe ſtrong Conſolations of God, being dilated, Capacitated, Elevated and enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that very end. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Communion is uninterrupted, there ſhall be nothing to mar it, no Croſs, no Sin, no Temptation to ſin, For no unclean thing enters within the Gates of the <hi>new Jeruſalem,</hi> no Curſe no Cry in thoſe Streets, no weeping, no Sorrow, no ſighing for any thing paſt, nor Horrour nor fear from the apprehenſion of any evil coming: nor any the leaſt miſ-turning of the Lambs Song of Praiſe; the heart ſhall (to ſpeak ſo) be ſo ſtringed and bended, as it ſhall never again ſlack in its bent, but be ſtil keeped at its higheſt note, our Harps ſhall never hang any more on the Willows, but we ſhall keep them ſtill in our hand chanting the Praiſes of the Redeemer to that new Heavenly Tune never heard on earth, with Pſalmes of victory in our hands and Crowns of Glory on our heads,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:179825:179"/> following the Lamb whitherſoever He goes. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is an Eternall communion, we ſhall drink for ever with him and be abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of his houſe, and made Holily drunk <hi>with the River of his pleaſures, with whom is the Fountain of Life, and in whoſe light we shall eminently ſee light;</hi> whoſe Well of life is always running, in <hi>Whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joys, and at his right hand Pleaſures for evermore;</hi> though through all Eternity thouſands and Millions will be drinking of this new Wine, yet it ſhall never be the leſs, but is and ſhall be ſtill freſh and flowing.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Application;</hi> Let me ask you, do ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, that there is ſuch a day coming, and that theſe are the true and Faithfull ſayings of God? O! If ye all that hear me this day did indeed believe it; the belief of it, ſure, is very ſuitable and would make a very ſweet life; ye will never be Holy, ye will never aright fear nor love God, ye will never hate ſin, nor be heartſome in his Service, neither will ye be truly thankful, till ye really Believe it: I am afraid, if Atheiſts, Earthly Wretches, drunkards, Tipplers, Curſers, Swearers, Hypocrites, &amp;c. Were ſingled out and Separated from among us, they would be found to be but a ſmal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who Believe this: Do ye or can ye Believe it, that have your Portion in this life, and ſeek no more? Nay, believers, if ye indeed Believe it, why are ye ſo heartleſs? Why envy ye the poor proſperity of the men of the world? Why do ye not preſs after this mark and Prize? If ye believed it ſuitably, your hearts would laugh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, your Spirits would rejoice, your faces would ſome way ſhine; and what is ſpoken of this day, would have a Divine ſplendor and luſtre in your eyes; If you believe it, why is it not your work and buſineſs to live ſo, as ye may hope to drink of this cup of this new Wine
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:179825:179"/> with Chriſt in Heaven? Though ye ſhould drink wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all your days, this Wine will abundantly compenſe that; though now the bread of ſome of you be but brown, this feaſt of truly Royal dainties is before you: our Chriſtian friends that are gone are feeding ſweetly on it. Long, O Believers to be with them, and take it not ill, though ye be here ſomewhat ſtraitned and kept ſcarce, and have but a litle portion, a ſmall pittance and ſcant meaſure of the things of this world, when others fare well and Sumptuouſly, live high, are Gorgiouſly apparelled: Your Feaſt and Royal Robes are before you. The Rich and great men of this world, whoſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in this life care litle for Poor bodies that ſeek G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d: care ye as litle for their portion as they care for yours; they ſhall not, a litle hence, get a drink, nay not a drop of cold water, when ye ſhall drink this new Wine, this Royal wine in abundance: Chriſts <hi>Servants shall eat, when they shall be hungry, his ſervants shall drink when they shall be thirſty: they shall ſing for joy of heart, when the others shall mourn and howl for vexation of ſpirit:</hi> as it is <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.13. O ſeek after clearneſs of intereſt in him, that ye may throughly Believe, Love, and long for this life. This heartſome Communion with Chriſt in Heaven is reſerved for them that keep Communion with him here on earth, and to them it is here promiſed: I will not ſay, that none can get Heaven, but thoſe who get the Sacrament: but this I dare boldly ſay, that thoſe who have not Communion with Chriſt here, ſhall never get Commvnion with him hereafter: and whoever Communicat honeſtly here ſhall have Communion with Chriſt in Glory: be ye comforted who believe in Chriſt, who Covenant honeſtly with him, and who <hi>hope in his mercy.</hi> For He and ye together ſhall have a compleatly full, immediat, uninterrupted
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:179825:180"/> and eternal Communion in Heaven, that ſhall new end. Need ye to be confirmed in the truth of this? hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Purpoſe comes in; even thus, as if the Lord had ſaid ye have now an excellent Communion-day; but ye and I will have no more together in this World; whence,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:179825:181"/> 
               <hi>Obſerve,</hi> that <hi>the beſt Communion day that Gods People have here hath a</hi> BUT <hi>in it,</hi> or <hi>ſomething that makes it appear defective;</hi> Only in that Communion in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven there in no <hi>But,</hi> no defect: And it implyes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> His ſaying to them, ye have now been at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but ere long ye ſhall meet with Temptation and trouble; and as he ſaid, ſo within a very litle it came to paſs. So may I ſay, we are here now, but do we know how ſoon a temptation may aſſault and prevail? The Tempter is waiting on and hath, it is like, given in his Petition for a Permiſſion to eſſay ſuch and ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by ſome ſuitable Temptation, ere to morrow; and he offers, it may be, to make his Hypocriſy to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: and it will be a ſad Matter, if any of you ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and be overtaken with the temptation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It looks to the ſcattering that was coming; we will not (as if we had ſaid) be all together at the Communion again; <hi>For it is written, I will ſmite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be ſcattered.</hi> It is more then Probable that we ſhall not all drink and eat at one Table again; are there not ſome both Miniſters and People dead and gone ſince the laſt Communion? And ye may want ſome of both, ere ye get another: and may there not ſome ſad diverſion, trouble or Confuſion ariſe, to the offending of ſome and laying of them aſide? Nay, ſome may be offended at theſe ſame Ordinances: Sathan hath many ways to break in upon us: nay let me tell you, that a cloud of perſecution may come and cover us, that we ſhall not dare to come, or may ſcruple to come to ſuch an Ordinance, though we be now datted and (as it were) Dandled on his knee. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may look to their being deprived of Chriſts company and bodily preſence. And who knoweth, but there may be a cloud of deſertion on Ordinances, and a vailing of Chriſts
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:179825:182"/> preſence? I forewarn you that it is to be ſeared; which ſayes, we should keep him well while we have him, and <hi>not ſtir him up till he pleaſe,</hi> as the Brides frequent deſire and reſolution is in the <hi>Song. Fourthly,</hi> It may look to death that is coming, and will put an end to all Communions here: after which there will be no moe Communions on Earth. And indeed, it is ſuitable, that ye were now bethinking your ſelves, what if we never get another? Ought we not then to feed well on this? If any thing have been amiſs or wanting, Labour to get it made up: O Believers in Chriſt, take hom a Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Covenant with you, and read it over and over again: If any defect hath been on your part, write it yet in: for if any blank be, 'tis certainly on our ſide and not on Chriſts: and indeed, 'tis Gods great mercy, that a Seal of his Covenant may be uſefull a long time after it is gotten: ſlighted Baptiſms and abuſed Communions may be yet uſefull, if we could make the right uſe of them: and I do not queſtion but this Communion did the Diſciples more good after Chriſt was gone from them, then it did now when he was with them at Table. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It may look to Eternity. Now we are living men and women on Earth but within a litle, we will be gone, &amp; <hi>our place will know us no more;</hi> very probably, within Twentie, Thirty, Fourty or Fifty years, we ſhall be either drinking of this <hi>new Wine</hi> in Heaven above, or of that Cup of the unmixed Wine of the wrath of God, having no reſt day nor night. O Profane Atheiſt, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, hollow hearted Hypocrite, and ſlighter of Chriſt all thy dayes, what a bitter draught will that be, when God ſhall put into thy hand the Cup of his I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? which ſhall be for ever poured out unto thee, and ſhall never come from thy head. O drunkard, tippler, and belly God, be think thy ſelf, how that draught will
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:179825:182"/> go down with thee: The Lord <hi>with his one foot on Earth and the other on the Sea, with an uplifted hand to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hath Sworn, that within a litle, time shal be no more.</hi> Ye that are young People may, if ye will, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſight of your eyes and the way of your own hearts, and may take you Pleaſure in the dayes of your youth, but know and remember that God will bring you to Judgement: Your time is wearing away, and ye will wear away: 'tis but a litle, and ye will hear no moe Preachings, and get no moe warnings. O take them in time, if ye be wiſe, and the Lord perſwade you ſo to do.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Third</hi> place, The ſcope both of the advertiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſolation is obſervable, when he was giving them the Cup and told them, that <hi>'tis the Cup of the new Teſtament in his blood,</hi> He ſubjoins, <hi>but I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth,</hi> &amp;c. This he doth, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe he would ſend them away advertiſed and aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>There is a father Ben</hi> (to ſpeak ſo) <hi>a more inward room in Religion, then the moſt lively and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Ordinance here on earth doth afford:</hi> a higher &amp; more intenſe ſpiritual Practice, then any outward part of Religion: He would have them to go away think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themſelves, that all is not done that may be done, that all is not win at, which may be had, that they are not yet Holy enough nor happy enough. O place not, for Chriſts ſake, Place not your Religion here, I was at the Sacrament, or I got my Communion: Wo to that empty ſound, and to them who lean all their weight on it: ye may come and abide here for a time, and go away leaving the marrow of the matter behind you: all is not yet done.

As ye would not, O Believers, interrupt your Communion with God in Chriſt, ſtudy to be Heavenly in your Converſation: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour:</hi> Lay aſide (as if be had ſaid) your earthly mindedneſs, away with that; and be Heavenly in your converſation; for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is ſuch; and Believers are deſcribed to be ſuch as <hi>Love Chriſts appearing.</hi> A <hi>Fourth Reaſon</hi> May be, that <hi>our Lord would hearten &amp; Comfort his Diſciples and ſend them away refreshed;</hi> Yea it is, to Root out their unbelief, and to arm them againſt approaching tryals: So then, <hi>Firſt.</hi> our Lord Jeſus <hi>Allows Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to go from the Communion, and proportionally, from every Ordinance rightly come to, cheerfull and Comforted;</hi> and therefore he leaves them with this word, telling them that they will have hard and ſad days; but withall bids them cheer themſelves in the aſſured expectation of a day coming, when He and they ſhall drink the Wine new in Heaven: Our Lord would have Believers humble, thinking on Death and making ready for it dayly; yet be would not have them tortured with the thoughts of it, but cheerfull, as having his joy for their ſtrength; though he would not have their joy carnal, but Heavenly: And it is the Token of a right Communicant and of a good hearer of the word, when a Perſon goes away from it more Spiritually cheered and more Heavenly minded. <hi>Secondly, There is nothing that can be more heartſome, cheering and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing to the Believer, then the lively hope of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and of a ſeat on the Throne, in Heaven with Chriſt; and it is the mark and Character of a believer, to have no lower deſigne.</hi> Alace! for the ſenſleſs way of hearing
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:179825:184"/> the word and of Communicating cuſtomary to many, who have no other nor higher deſigne, then to partake of the outward Ordinance: 'tis a heart ſome thing to go from the Table of the Lord with this ſweet and Heavenly Meditation, Chriſt and I will meet again ere long at a table in Heaven. <hi>Thirdly, The thoughts of Heaven and the hope thereof may well ſuſtain a Believe, were there never ſo many</hi> BUTS <hi>and wants in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition here:</hi> We will not be long together, ſaith He, there will be a ſcattering; but this may keep you from weeping and mourning as thoſe who have no hope, that the day cometh when we ſhall meet again, and never, part aſunder: It is really a wonder, that we have ſo few ſerious and ſolacing thoughts of coming to Heaven: there are none who look for a Rich loading, coming home by Sea, but they will comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the expectation of it; why do we not then comfort our ſelves in the thoughts of Heaven, ſince we profeſs to have a hope of being there? even becauſe we are carnal and earthly: and it ſayes, that we either think Heaven litle worth, or that it is an inſufficient and unvalid right, that is to be had to it, or that we do not really believe it: all the ſilver and gold in the world comforts not a poor body, becauſe he hath no hope to come by it; So there are not a few hearers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, who bear much of Heaven and of the hope of it, that never refreſheth them. A <hi>Fifth Reaſon</hi> may be <hi>to waken up longing deſires, and to sharpen and put an edge upon an appetit, in his followers, after Heaven,</hi> and to teach them <hi>not to place their happineſs in any thing on this ſide Heaven:</hi> otherwiſe he would never have put their Satisfaction to a term ſo far off: but he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaps (to ſpeak ſo with reverence) all the brave days, that they had and were to have here, and gives them this

Believers in Chriſt, cheer your ſelves in the hope of it: If there be any of you (as Alace! I fear there be very many) that reliſh not this bleſſed change, there is a ſad and Sorrowful change before you. O be buſie, very buſie to have your intereſt in Chriſt, and the hope of Heaven well ſecured, by Union and Communion with him here; that ſo ye may have the well grounded hope of Heaven, and may frequently draw Comfort from it: And, O that we could ſunder ſo.
